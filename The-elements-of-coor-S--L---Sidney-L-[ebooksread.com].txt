NATURE says ; " ...It would be difficult to find a better introduc- 
tion to Plane Trigonometry." 

The SCHOOL GUARDIAN says; " ...It is a model of method, 
clearness, and accuracy ; and the simplicity of its explanations, its 
numerous illustrative diagrams, and its large and varied collection of 
exercises and examples combine to render it especially suitable for the 
use of young pupils and private students.... The typography of the 
volume is in every respect admirable...." 



The SCHOOLMASTER says; " ...Mr Loney, using the soundest 
judgment in his choice of matter, presents it with inimitable brevity 
and clearness ; the publishers, too, have vied with the author in their 
efforts to excel, and, as a result, the book is in every way worthy of 
commendation." 

The SCOTSMAN says ; " ...It expounds the subject with a skill 
and fulness which give evidence of a peculiar experience in teaching 
and of a special appreciation of the needs of students. " 

The PRACTICAL TEACHER says; "...Among its numerous 
competitors it cannot fail to attain a deservedly high and popular 
position." 

The NATIONAL TEACHER (Ireland) says ; '• ...Seldom do such 
books come under the notice of the reviewer. For conciseness and 
clearness it has few compeers. It is deep without dullness ; compre- 
hensive without wearisomeness. It comes before us with a newness 
and freshness almost amounting to novelty...." 

The SPEAKER says ; "Mr Loney as a writer of elementary 
mathematical treatises maintains a high standard. His Elementary 
Dynamics is marked by its brevity and clearness and deserves its 
success.... The Cambridge Press has every reason to be proud of its 
achievement." 

The EDUCATIONAL REVIEW says; "...The author has not 
made a special point of developing any one particular branch of the 
subject, but his work is of uniform character throughout, and, we 
may add, of uniformly good quality.... The arrangement of sections is 
excellent ; the attention is clearly directed to important points, and 
the style in which the book is produced may be fairly described as 
luxurious." 

The GLASGOW HERALD says ; " ...Mr Loney's text-book is sure 
to be widely used in the several mathematical classes where sound work 
is expected. The publisher's part of the work is also most admirably 
done. " 

The UNIVERSITY CORRESPONDENT says; "...It is well 
written and the chapters relating to the changes of sign and mag- 
nitude of trigonometrical ratios in different quadrants are especially 
deserving of praise...." 

SCIENCE AND ART says; "...In the analytical part of the 
subject, considerable attention has been given to complex quantities, 
and the author is to be congratulated on the lucid way in which he 
has treated them.... The book may be strongly recommended as a 
first-rate text-book."

"TN the following work I have tried to present the 
elements of Coordinate Geometry in a manner 
suitable for Beginners and Junior Students. The 
present book only deals with Cartesian and Polar 
Coordinates. Within these limits I venture to hope 
that the book is fairly complete, and that no proposi- 
tions of very great importance have been omitted. 

The Straight Line and Circle have been treated 
more fully than the other portions of the subject, 
since it is generally in the elementary conceptions 
that beginners find great difficulties. 

There are a large number of Examples, over 1100 
in all, and they are, in general, of an elementary 
character. The examples are especially numerous in 
the earlier parts of the book. 



vi PREFACE. 

I am much indebted to several friends for reading 
portions of the proof sheets, but especially to Mr W. 
J. Dobbs, M.A. who has kindly read the whole of the 
book and made many valuable suggestions. 

For any criticisms, suggestions, or corrections, I 
shall be grateful.

CHAPTER I. 

INTRODUCTION. 

SOME ALGEBRAIC RESULTS. 

1. Quadratic Equations. The roots of the quad- 
ratic equation 

a'3^ + 6x + c = 

may easily be shewn to be 

- &amp; + •JlP' — 4ac 1 -b- s/b^ — 4:aG 
2i. '^"'^ 2^ • 

They are therefore real and unequal, equal, or imaginary, 
according as the quantity b^—iac is positive, zero, or negative, 

i.e. according as b^ = 4:ac. 

2. Relations between the roots of any algebraic equation 
and the coejicients of the terms of the equation. 

If any equation be written so that the coefficient of the 
highest term is unity, it is shewn in any treatise on Algebra 
that 

(1) the sum of the roots is equal to the coefficient of 
the second term with its sign changed, 

(2) the sum of the products of the roots, taken two 
at a time, is equal to the coefficient of the third term, 

(3) the sum of their products, taken three at a time, 
is equal to the coefficient of the fourth term with its sign 
changed, 

and so on.

Ex. 1. If a and /3 be the roots of the equation 

b c 
ax'^ + bx + c = 0, i.e. x^ + - x + ~ = 0,

we have 



b -. ^ c 
a + p= — and a^ = - 



Ex. 2. If a, j8, and 7 be the roots of the cubic equation 
ax^ + bx^ + cx + d=0, 



i.e. of 
we have

i.e, by Art. 4, for the quantity

i.e. % (62C3 — h..G^ + (^2 (63C1 — 61C3) + «3 (61C2 — 62C1). 

6. A determinant of the third order is therefore reduced 
to three determinants of the second order by the following 
rule : 

Take in order the quantities which occur in the first row 
of the determinant ; multiply each of these in turn by the 
determinant which is obtained by erasing the row and 
column to which it belongs ; prefix the sign + and — al- 
ternately to the products thus obtained and add the 
results. 

Thus, if in (1) we omit the row and column to which a^ 

belongs, we have left the determinant ^' 



^ i and this is the 



coefficient of a-^ in (2). 

Similarly, if in (1) we omit the row and column to which 

a^ belongs, we have left the determinant ^' 



and this 



-'D 



with the — sign prefixed is the coefficient of a^ in (2).

and its value may be obtained by finding the value of each 
of these four determinants by the rule of Art. 6. 

The rule for finding the value of a determinant of the 
fourth order in terms of determinants of the third order is 
clearly the same as that for one of the third order given in 
Art. 6. 

Similarly for determinants of higher orders. 

9. A determinant of the second order has two terms. 
One of the third order has 3x2, i.e. 6, terms. One of the 
fourth order has 4 x 3 x 2, -i.e. 24, terms, and so on.

ELIMINATION. 5 

Elimination. 

11. Suppose we have the two equations 

aj^x + a^y = (1), 

\x +b^y ^0 (2), 

between the two unknown quantities x and y. There must 
be some relation holding between the four coefficients 6*i, ctaj 
bi, and 63 • ^or, from (1), we have 

y~ %' 

and, from (2), we have - = — =-^ . 

y K 

X 

Equating these two values of - we have 

i.e. a-J)^ — ajb^ = (3). 

The result (3) is the condition that both the equations 
(1) and (2) should be true for the same values of x and y. 
The process of finding this condition is called the elimi- 
nating of X and y from the equations (1) and (2), and the 
result (3) is often called the eliminant of (1) and (2). 

Using the notation of Art. 4, the result (3) may be 

1 ) '^ 

This result is obtained from (1) and (2) by taking the 
coefficients of x and y in the order in which they occur in 
the equations, placing them in this order to form a determi- 
nant, and equating it to zero. 



written in the form 



0. 



12. Suppose, again, that we have the three equations 

a-^x + a^y + a^^ = (1), 

\x+ h^y^ h^z = (2), 

and G^x + G^y + C3S = (3), 

between the three unknown quantities x, y, and z.

By dividing each equation by z we have three equations

these will be sufficient to determine these quantities. By 
substituting their values in the third equation we shall 
obtain a relation between the nine coefficients. 

Or we may proceed thus. From the equations (2) and 
(3) we have 

X __ y _ ^ 

Substituting these values in (1), we have 

«1 (^2^3 - ^3^2) + «2 (^3^1 - ^1^3) + «3 (^1^2 - ^2^1) = 0. . .(4). 

This is the result of eliminating cc, 3/, and % from the 
equations (1), (2), and (3). 

But, by Art. 5, equation (4) may be written in the form 



= 0. 



This eliminant may be written down as in the last 
article, viz. by taking the coefficients of x, y, and z in the 
order in which they occur in the equations (1), (2), and (3), 
placing them to form a determinant, and equating it to 
zero. 

13. Ex. What is the value of a so that the equations 
ax + 2y + 3z = 0, 2x-3y + 4:Z = 0, 
and 5x + 7y-8z=:0 

may be simultaneously true ? 

Eliminating x, y, and z, we have 
a, 2, 3, 
2, -3, 41 = 0, 
5, 7, -8! 
^.e. « [( - 3) ( - 8) - 4 X 7] - 2 [2 X { - 8) - 4 X 5] + 3 [2 X 7 - 5 X ( - 3)]=0, 
i.e. «[-4]-2[-36] + 3[29] = 0, 

^, ^ 72 + 87 159 

so that a= — -, = — ;- .

ELIMINATION. 



14. If again we have the four equations 

a-^x + dil/ + cf'zZ + a^u = 0, 

h^x + h^y + b^z + b^u = 0, 

Ci«; + c^i/ + G^z + c^u = 0, 

and djX + d^y + d.^z + d^ — 0, 

it could be shewn that the result of eliminating the four 
quantities cc, y, z^ and u is the determinant

A similar theorem could be shewn to be true for n 
equations of the first degree, such as the above, between 
n unknown quantities. 

It will be noted that the right-hand member of each of 
the above equations is zero. 



CHAPTER II. 

COORDINATES. LENGTHS OF STRAIGHT LINES AND 
AREAS OF TRIANGLES. 



15. Coordinates. Let OX and 07 be two fixed 
straight lines in the plane of the paper. The line OX is 
called the axis of cc, the line OY the axis of y, whilst the 
two together are called the axes of coordinates. 

The point is called the origin of coordinates or, more 
shortly, the origin. 

From any point F in the 
plane draw a straight line 
parallel to OF to meet OX 
in M. 

The distance OM is called 
the Abscissa, and the distance 
MP the Ordinate of the point 
P, whilst the abscissa and the 
ordinate together are called 
its Coordinates. 

Distances measured parallel to OX are called a?, with 
or without a suffix, {e.g.Xj, x.-^... x\ x",...), and distances 
measured parallel to OY are called y, with or without a 
suffix, (e.g. 2/i, 2/2,--- 2/'. y",---)- 

If the distances OM and MP be respectively x and ?/, 
the coordinates of P are, for brevity, denoted by the symbol 
{x, y). 

Conversely, when we are given that the coordinates of 
a point P are (x, y) we know its position. For from we 
have only to measure a distance OM {—x) along OX and 




COORDINATES. 9 

then from 21 measure a distance MP {=y) parallel to OY 
and we arrive at the position of the point P. For example 
in the figure, if OM be equal to the unit of length and 
MP= WM, then P is the point (1, 2). 

16. Produce XO backwards to form the line OX' and 
YO backwards to become OY'. In Analytical Geometry 
we have the same rule as to signs that the student has 
already met with in Trigonometry. 

Lines measured parallel to OX are positive whilst those 
measured parallel to OX' are negative ; lines measured 
parallel to OY are positive and those parallel to OY' are 
negative. 

If P2 b® i^ *li® quadrant YOX' and P^M^, drawn 
parallel to the axis of y, meet OX' in M^^ and if the 
numerical values of the quantities OM^ and J/aPg be a 
and h, the coordinates of P are {-a and h) and the position 
of Pg is given by the symbol (—a, h). 

Similarly, if P3 be in the third quadrant X'OY', both of 
its coordinates are negative, and, if the numerical lengths 
of Oi/3 and J/3P3 be c and d, then P3 is denoted by the 
symbol (— c, — d). 

Finally, if P4 lie in the fourth quadrant its abscissa is 
positive and its ordinate is negative. 

17. Ex. Lay down on "paper the position of the points 

(i) (2, -1), (ii) (-3, 2), and (iii) (-2, -3). 

To get the first point we measure a distance 2 along OX and then 
a distance 1 parallel to OF'; we thus arrive at the required point. 

To get the second point, we measure a distance 3 along OX', and 
then 2 parallel to OY. 

To get the third point, we measure 2 along OX' and then 
3 parallel to OT. 

These three points are respectively the points P4 , P., , and Pg in 
the figure of Art. 15. 

18. When the axes of coordinates are as in the figure 
of Art. 15, not at right angles, they are said to be Oblique 
Axes, and the angle between their two positive directions 
OX and 07, i.e. the angle XOY, is generally denoted by 
the Greek letter w. 



10 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

In general, it is however found to be more convenient to 
take the axes OX and OZat right angles. They are then 
said to be Rectangular Axes. 

It may always be assumed throughout this book that 
the axes are rectangular unless it is otherwise stated. 

19. The system of coordinates spoken of in the last 
few articles is known as the Cartesian System of Coordi- 
nates. It is so called because this system was first intro- 
duced by the philosopher Des Cartes. There are other 
systems of coordinates in use, but the Cartesian system is 
by far the most important. 

20. To find the distance between two points whose co- 
ordinates are given. 

Let Pi and P^ be the two 
given points, and let their co- 
ordinates be respectively {x^ , y^) 

and (a^sj 2/2)- 

Draw Pji/i and P^M^ pa- 
rallel to OY, to meet OX in 
J/j and M^. Draw P^R parallel 
to OX to meet M-^P^ in R. q ' M jvT 

Then 

P^R = M^Mt^ = OM^ - OMc^ = oi^-X2, 

RP, = M,P,-M,P, = y,~y,, 

and z P^i^Pi = z6&gt;ifiPa-l 80° -PiJfiX^l 80° -&lt;o. 

We therefore have [Trigonometry, Art. 164] 

P^P^^ = P^R^ + RP^^ - 2P^R . PPi cos P^RP^ 

- (^1 - x^Y + (2/1 - 2/2)' - 2 (a^i - x^) (2/1 - 2/2) cos (180° - (o) 

= (Xi-X2)2 + (yj_y2)2+2(Xi-X2)(yi-y2)COSCO...(l). 

If the axes be, as is generally the case, at right angles, 
we have &lt;o == 90° and hence cos to = 0. 

The formula (1) then becomes 

P^P^ - (x, - x^Y + (2/1 - y^Y^ 




DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS.

SO that in rectangular coordinates the distance between the 
two points (x^j y^ and (a-g, 2/2) is 

V(Xi - x^)^ + (Yi - y^)^ (2). 

Cor. The distance of the point (x^, y-^ from the origin 
is Jx^ + 2/1^, the axes being rectangular. This follows from 
(2) by making both x^ and y^ equal to zero. 

21. The formula of the previous article has been proved for the 
case when the coordinates of both the points are all positive.! 

Due regard being had to the signs of the coordinates, the formula 
will be found to be true for all 
points. 

As a numerical example, let 
Pj be the point (5, 6) and Pg 
be the point (-7, -4), so that 
we have 

and y2= -^. 

Then 
P^ = 31^0 + OM^ = 7 + 5 

and 

RPt^ = EM-^ + l/iPj = 4 + 6 

= -2/2 + 2/1. 
The rest of the proof is as in the last article. 

Similarly any other case could be considered.

Take B as origin, 5C as the axis of x, and a line through B i&gt;er-

Let BG=a, so that G is the point (a, 0), and let A be the point 

Then D is the point (|&gt; C&gt; j . 

Hence ^D2=ra;i -^Y + i/i^ and DG^=f~y.

Let ABGD be the trapezium having the sides AD and 
BC parallel. 

Join AC and draw AL perpen- 
dicular to BG and ON perpendicular 
to AD^ produced if necessary. 

Since the area of a triangle is one 
half the product of any side and the

area ABGD = ^ABG ■¥ ^AGD

Draw AL, BM, and Ci\^ per-

The area of the triangle in this case becomes

27. In order that the expression for the area in Art. 25 may be 
a positive quantity (as all areas necessarily are) the points A, B, and 
G must be taken in the order in which they would be met by a 
person starting from A and walking round the triangle in such a

30. Polar Coordinates. There is another method, 
which is often used, for determining the position of a point 
in a plane. 

Suppose to be a fixed point, called the origin or 
pole, and OX a fixed line, called the initial line. 

Take any other point P in the plane of the paper and 
join OP. The position of P is clearly known when the 
angle XOP and the length OP are given. 

[For giving the angle XOP shews the direction in which OP is 
drawn, and giving the distance OP tells the distance of P along this 
direction.] 

The angle XOP which would be traced out by the line 
OP in revolving from the initial line OX is called the 
vectorial angle of P and the length OP is called its radius 
vector. The two taken together are called the polar co- 
ordinates of P. 

If the vectorial angle be and the radius vector be r, the 
position of P is denoted by the symbol (r, 0). 

The radius vector is positive if it be measured from the 
origin along the line bounding the vectorial angle; if 
measured in the opposite direction it is negative. 

31. Ex. Construct the positions of the 'points (i) (2, 80°), 

(ii) (3, 150°), (iii) (-2, 45°), (iv) ■ 

(-3, 330°), (v) (3, -210°) and (vi) ff\ /^ 

(-3, -30°). ^\^ ,-&gt;^^ 

(i) To construct the first point, ^^^^^^^^^"^^ 

let the radius vector revolve from '/^^^ yC 

OX through an angle of 30°, and &gt;/ ""-., 

then mark off along it a distance y ''-•., 

equal to two units of length. We 'p M" 

thus obtain the point P^. ^ 

(ii) For the second point, the radius vector revolves from OX 
through 150° and is then in the position OP^ ; measuring a distance 3 
along it we arrive at Pg . 

2—2 



20 COORDINATE GEOMETKY. 

(iii) For the third point, let the radius vector revolve from OX 
through 45° into the position OL. We have now to measure along 
OL a distance - 2, i.e. we have to measure a distance 2 not along OL 
but in the opposite direction. Producing iO to Pg, so that OP3 is 
2 units of length, we have the required point P3. 

(iv) To get the fourth point, we let the radius vector rotate from 
OX through 330° into the position OM and measure on it a distance 
-3, i.e. 3 in the direction MO produced. We thus have the point P^y 
which is the same as the point given by (ii). 

(v) If the radius vector rotate through - 210°, it will be in the 
position OP2, and the point required is Pg. 

(vi)^ For the sixth point, the radius vector, after rotating through 
- 30°, is in the position OM: We then measure - 3 along it, i.e. 3 in 
the direction MO produced, and once more arrive at the point Pg. 

32. It will be observed that in the previous example 
the same point P^ is denoted by each of the four sets of 
polar coordinates 

(3, 150°), (-3, 330°), (3, -210°) and (-3, -30°). 
In general it v^ill be found that the same point is given 
by each of the polar coordinates 
(r, 0), (- r, 180° + 6), {r, - (360° - 6)] and {- r, - (180° - 6% 

or, expressing the angles in radians, by each of the co- 
ordinates 

(r, e\ {-r,7r + 6), {r, - (27r - 0)} and {- r, - (tt - $)}. 

It is also clear that adding 360° (or any multiple of 
360°) to the vectorial angle does not alter the final position 
of the revolving line, so that {r, 6) is always the same point 
as (r, ^ + ?i . 360°), where n is an integer. 

So, adding 180° or any odd multiple of 180° to the 
vectorial angle and changing the sign of the radius vector 
gives the same point as before. Thus the point 

[-r, ^ + (2n + 1)180°] 

is the same point as [— r, 6 + 180°], i.e. is the point [r, 6\ 

33. To find the length of the straight line joining two 
points whose polar coordinates are given. 

Let A and B be the two points and let their polar 
coordinates be (r^, 6y) and (r^, 6^ respectively, so that 
OA^r^, OB = r^, lXOA^O^, and lX0B = 6^,

Then (Trigonometry, Art. 164) 

AB" - OA'' + OB'' -20 A. OB cos AOB

34. To find the area of a triangle the coordinates of 
whose angular points are given. 

Let ABC be the triangle and let (r-^, 0^), (r^, 62), and 
(rg, ^3) be the polar coordinates of 
its angular points. 
We have 
AABO=AOBC+aOCA 

-AOBA (1). 

Now 

A0BC = i0B,0C sin BOC 
[Trigonometry, Art. 198] 
= ^r^r^ sin (^3 - $^). 

' So A OCA = \0G . OA sin CO A = ^r^r, sin (6, - 6,), 
and AOAB^^OA. OB sin AOB = ^r^r^ sin {6^ - 6.^ 
= - Jn^2 sin (^2 - ^1). 
Hence (1) gives 
A ABC = J \r&lt;^r^ sin (^3 - 6^ + r^r^ (sin 0-^ - 0^)

ferred to as pole and OX as 
initial line, are (r, 6). 

Draw Pit/'perpendicular to OX 
so that we have 

OM=x, MP = y, LMOP = e, 
and OP = r. 

From the triangle MOP we 
have 

x = OM=OPcosMOP = rcosO (1), 

y = MP= OPsinMOP ^r smO (2),

CHAPTER III. 

LOCUS. EQUATION TO A LOCUS. 

36. When a point moves so as always to satisfy a 
given condition, or conditions, the path it traces out is 
called its Locus under these conditions. 

For example, suppose to be a given point in the plane 
of the paper and that a point F is to move on the paper so 
that its distance from shall be constant and equal to a. 
It is clear that all the positions of the moving point must 
lie on the circumference of a circle whose centre is and 
whose radius is a. The circumference of this circle is 
therefore the " Locus" of P when it moves subject to the 
condition that its distance from shall be equal to the 
constant distance a. 

37. Again, suppose A and B to be two fixed points in 
the plane of the paper and that a point P is to move in 
the plane of the paper so that its distances from A and B 
are to be always equal. If we bisect AB in G and through 
it draw a straight line (of infinite length in both directions) 
perpendicular to AB, then any point on this straight line 
is at equal distances from A and B. Also there is no 
point, whose distances from A and B are the same, which 
does not lie on this straight line. This straight line is 
therefore the "Locus" of P subject to the assumed con- 
dition. 

38. Again, suppose A and B to be two fixed points 
and that the point P is to move in the plane of the paper 
so that the angle APB is always a right angle. If we 
describe a circle on AB as diameter then P may be any

25 



point on the circumference of this circle, since the angle 
in a semi-circle is a right angle; also it could easily be 
shewn that APB is not a right angle except when P lies 
on this circumference. The "Locus" of P under the 
assumed condition is therefore a circle on -4^ as diameter. 

39. One single equation between two unknown quan- 
tities x and y, e.g. 

x + y = l (1), 

cannot completely determine the values of x and y.

Such an equation has an infinite number of solutions. 
Amongst them are the followins: : 



a: = 0,1 


a; =1,1 
2/ = 0/' 


x= 2,1 

y=-l/' 


x= 3,1 
y=-2/'- 
x = —\,\ X — — 2 
2/= 2/' y= 3 









Let us mark down on paper a number of points whose 
coordinates (as defined in the last chapter) satisfy equation 

Let OX and OF be the axes of coordinates. 

If we mark off a distance OPi (—1) along OY^ we have 
a point Pi whose coordinates (0, 1) clearly satisfy equation 

If we mark off a distance OP^ (=1) along OX, we have 
a point Pg whose coordinates (1, 0) satisfy (1). 



26 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Similarly the point Pg, (2, — 1), and P4, (3, — 2), satisfy 
the equation (1). 

Again, the coordinates (—1, 2) of Pg and the coordinates 
(—2, 3) of Pg satisfy equation (1). 

On making the measurements carefully we should find 
that all the points we obtain lie on the line P^P^ (produced 
both ways). 

Again, if we took any point Q, lying on P^P^, and draw 
a perpendicular QM to OX, we should find on measurement 
that the sum of its x and y (each taken with its proper 
sign) would be equal to unity, so that the coordinates of Q 
would satisfy (1). 

Also we should find no point, whose coordinates satisfy 
(1), which does not lie on P1P2. 

All the points, lying on the straight line P1P2, and no 
others are therefore such that their coordinates satisfy the 
equation (1). 

This result is expressed in the language of Analytical 
Geometry by saying that (1) is the Equation to the Straight 
Line P^P^. 

40. Consider again the equation 

£c2 + 2/2 = 4 (1). 

Amongst an infinite number of solutions of this equa- 
tion are the following : 

x = 2A x= J?&gt;\ x = J\ x^l \

All these points are respectively represented by the 
points P^, P^^ F^y ... P^Qj and they 
will all be found to lie on the 
dotted circle whose centre is 
and radius is 2. 

Also, if we take any other 
point Q on this circle and its 
ordinate QM, it follows, since 
0M^- + MQ^^0Q' = 4:, that the x 
and y of the point Q satisfies (1). 

The dotted circle therefore 
passes through all the points whose 
coordinates satisfy (1). 

In the language of Analytical Geometry the equation 
(1) is therefore the equation to the above circle. 

41. As another example let us trace the locus of the 
point whose coordinates satisfy the equation 

y'=4^'^ (1); 

If we give x a negative value we see that y is im- 
possible; for the square of a 
real quantity cannot be nega- 
tive. 

We see therefore that there 
are no points lying to the left 
of OF. 

If we give x any positive 
value we see that y has two 
real corresponding values which 
are equal and of opposite signs. 

The following values, 
amongst an infinite number of 
others, satisfy (1), viz. 

x = 0,] x=l, "I x = 2, 

y = 0}' y = + 2or-2}' y = 2J2ov -2J2

Pg and Q^, P^and Q^, ... represent the next pairs of points.

28 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

If we took a large number of values of x and the 
corresponding values of ?/, the points thus obtained would 
be found all to lie on the curve in the figure. 

Both of its branches would be found to stretch away to 
infinity towards the right of the figure. 

Also, if we took any point on this curve and measured 
with sufficient accuracy its x and y the values thus obtained 
would be found to satisfy equation (1). 

Also we should not be able to find any point, not lying 
on the curve, whose coordinates would satisfy (1). 

In the language of Analytical Geometry the equation 
(1) is the equation to the above curve. This curve is called 
a Parabola and will be fully discussed in Chapter X. 

42. If a point move so as to satisfy any given condition 
it will describe some definite curve, or locus, and there can 
always be found an equation between the x and y of any 
point on the path. 

This equation is called the equation to the locus or 
curve. Hence 

Def. Equation to a curve. The equation to a 
curve is the relation which exists between the coordinates of 
any foint on the curve^ and which holds for no other points 
except those lying on the curve. 

43. Conversely to every equation between x and y it 
will be found that there is, in general, a definite geometrical 
locus. 

Thus in Art. 39 the equation is x + y=\, and the 
definite path, or locus, is the straight line P^P^ (produced 
indefinitely both ways). 

In Art. 40 the equation is x'^ + y'^^ 4, and the definite 
path, or locus, is the dotted circle. 

Again the equation 2/ = 1 states that the moving point 
is such that its ordinate is always unity, i.e. that it is 
always at a distance 1 from the axis of x. The definite 
path, or locus, is therefore a straight line parallel to OX 
and at a distance unity from it. 



EQUATION TO A LOCUS. 29 

44. In the next chapter it will be found that if the 
equation be of the first degree {i.e. if it contain no 
products, squares, or higher powers of x and y) the locus 
corresponding is always a straight line. 

If the equation be of the second or higher degree, the 
corresponding locus is, in general, a curved line. 

45. We append a few simple examples of the forma- 
tion of the equation to a locus. 

Ex. 1. A point moves so that the algebraic sum of its distances 
from tioo given perpendicular axes is equal to a constant quantity a; 
find the equation to its locus. 

Take the two straight lines as the axes of coordinates. Let {x, y) 
be any point satisfying the given condition. We then ha,wex + y = a. 
This being the relation connecting the coordinates of any point 
on the locus is the equation to the locus. 

It will be found in the next chapter that this equation represents 
a straight line. 

Ex. 2. The sum of the squares of the distances of a moving point 
from the tioo fixed points {a, 0) and {-a, 0) is equal to a constant 
quantity 2c^. Find the equation to its locus. 

Let (a;, y) be any position of the moving point. Then, by Art. 20, 
the condition of the question gives 

{ [x - af + /} + { (a; + af + if] = 2c\ 
i.Ci x^ + y'^ = c^- a~. 

This being the relation between the coordinates of any, and every, 
point that satisfies the given condition is, by Art. 42, the equation to 
the required locus. 

This equation tells us that the square of the distance of the point 
{x, y) from the origin is constant and equal to c^ - a^, and therefore 
the locus of the point is a circle whose centre is the origin. 

Ex. 3. A point moves so that its distance from the point (-1,0) 
is always three times its distance from the point (0, 2). 

Let {x, y) be any point which satisfies the given condition. We 

then have 

J{x + iy' + {y-0)^=Bj{x - 0)2+ {y - 2)2, 
so that, on squaring, 

x'^ + 2x + l + y'^=9{x'^ + y'^-4:y + 4), 
i.e. 8(a;2 + y2)_2a;-36?/ + 35 = 0. 

This being the relation between the coordinates of each, and 
every, point that satisfies the given relation is, by Art. 42, the 
required equation. 

It will be found, in a later chapter, that this equation represents 
a circle.

the axis of y. 

17. its distance from the point (a, 0) is always four times its dis- 
tance from the axis of y. 

18. the sum of the squares of its distances from the axes is equal 
to 3. 

19. the square of its distance from the point (0, 2) is equal to 4. 

20. its distance from the point (3, 0) is three times its distance 
from (0, 2). 

21. its distance from the axis of x is always one half its distance 
from the origin. 

22. A fixed point is at a perpendicular distance a from a fixed 
straight line and a point moves so that its distance from the fixed 
point is always equal to its distance from the fixed line. Find the 
equation to its locus, the axes of coordinates being drawn through 
the fixed point and being parallel and perpendicular to the given 
line. 

23. In the previous question if the first distance be (1), always half, 
and (2), always twice, the second distance, find the equations to the 
respective loci. 



CHAPTER IV. 

THE STRAIGHT LINE. RECTANGULAR COORDINATES. 

46. To find the equation to a straight line which is 
parallel to one of the coordinate axes. 

Let CL be any line parallel to the axis of y and passing 
through a point C on the axis of x such that OG = c. 

Let F be any point on this line whose coordinates are 
X and y. 

Then the abscissa of the point F is 
always c, so that 

x = c (1). 

This being true for every point on 
the line CL (produced indefinitely both 
ways), and for no other point, is, by 
Art. 42, the equation to the line. 

It will be noted that the equation does not contain the 
coordinate y. 

Similarly the equation to a straight line parallel to the 
axis oi X is y — d. 

Cor. The equation to the axis of a? is 2/ = 0. 
The equation to the axis oi y is x — 0. 

47. To find the equation to a st7'aight line which cuts 
off a given intercept on the axis of y and is inclined at a 
given angle to the axis of x. 

Let the given intercept be c and let the given angle be a. 



X 



32 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Let C be a point on the axis of y such that OC is c. 
Through C draw a straight 
line Z(7Z' inclined at an angle 
a (= tan~^ m) to the axis of x^ 
so that tan a — m. 

The straight line LCL' is ^^ 

therefore the straight line ^^ 
required, and we have to -'l O MX 

find the relation between the 
coordinates of any point P lying on it. 

Draw PM perpendicular to OX to meet in ^ a line 
through G parallel to OX. 

Let the coordinates of P be cu and ?/» so that OM=x 
and MP = y. 

Then MP = NP + MN =C]Srt^iia + 00 = m.x + c, 
i.e. y = mx+c. 

This relation being true for any point on the given 
straight line is, by Art. 42, the equation to the straight 
line. 

[In this, and other similar cases, it could be shewn, 
conversely, that the equation is only true for points lying 
on the given straight line.] 

Cor. The equation to any straight line passing through 
the origin, i.e. which cuts off a zero intercept from the axis 
of 2/, is found by putting c — O and hence is 3/ = mx. 

48. The angle a which is used in the previous article is the 
angle through which a straight line, originally parallel to OZ, would 
have to turn in order to coincide with the given direction, the rotation 
being always in the positive direction. Also m is always the tangent 
of this angle. In the case of such a straight line as AB, in the figure 
of Art. 50, m is equal to the tangent of the angle PAX (not of the 
angle PAO). In this case therefore wi, being the tangent of an obtuse 
angle, is a negative quantity. 

The student should verify the truth of the equation of the last 
article for all points on the straight line LCL', and also for straight 
Hnes in other positions, e.g. for such a straight line as A^B^ in the 
figure of Art. 59. In this latter case both m and c are negative 
quantities. 

A careful consideration of all the possible cases of a few proposi- 
tions will soon satisfy him that this verification is not always 
necessary, but that it is sufficient to consider the standard figure. 



THE STRAIGHT LINE. 



33 



49. Ex. The equation to the straight line cutting off an 
intercept 3 from the negative direction of the axis of y, and inclined 
at 120° to the axis of a;, is 

?/ = a;tanl20° + (-3), 

i.e. y= -x^S-S, 

i.e. y + x^S + S = 0. 

50. 1^0 find the equation to the straight line which cuts 
off given i7itercepts a and h from the axes. 

Let A and B be on OX and OY respectively, and be 
such that OA = a and OB = h. 

Join AB and produce it in- 
definitely both ways. Let P be 
any point (x, y) on this straight 
line, and draw PM perpendicular 
to OX. 

We require the relation that 
always holds between x and 3/, so 
long as P lies on AB. 

By Euc. YI. 4, we have

OA~AB' ^"""^ 'OB~AB 




OM MP PB + AP

OA OB 



AB 



= 1, 



^.e. 



X y ^ 
a D 



This is therefore the required equation ; for it is the 
relation that holds between the coordinates of any point 
lying on the given straight line. 

51. The equation in the preceding article may he also obtained 
by expressing the fact that the sum of the areas of the triangles OP A 
and OPB is equal to OAB, so that 

\axy + \hy.x = \ax'b, 



and hence 



a 



52. Ex. 1. Find the equation to the straight line passing 
through the -point (3, - 4) and cutting off intercepts, equal but of 
opposite signs, from the tioo axes. 

Let the intercepts cut off from the two axes be of lengths a and 



— a. 



34 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



The equation to the straight line is then 

a -a 

i.e. x-y = a (1). 

Since, in addition, the straight line is to go through the point 
(3, -4), these coordinates must satisfy (1), so that 

3-(-4) = a, 
and therefore a = l. 

The required equation is therefore 

x-y = 7. 

Ex. 2. Find the equation to the straight line lohich passes through 
the point (-5, 4) and is such that the portion of it between the axes is 
divided by the point in the ratio ofl : 2. 

Let the required straight line be - + t = 1. This meets the axes 

a b 

in the points whose coordinates are {a, 0) and (0, &amp;). 

The coordinates of the point dividing the line joining these 

points in the ratio 1 : 2, are (Art. 22) 



2.a+1.0 , 2.0 + 1.&amp; 
If this be the point ( - 5, 4) we have 



. 2(1 , b 
i.e,-^ and -. 



„ 2a , , b 
-5:=- and 4=-, 

so that a=--Y- and b = 12. 

The required straight line is therefore 

X y 



-i^^l2 ' 



I.e. 



oy 



8a; = 60. 



53. To find the equation to a straight line in tenns of 
the perpendicular let fall upon it from the origin and the 
angle that this perpendicular makes with the axis of x. 

Let OR be the perpendicular from and let its length 
be jo. 

Let a be the angle that OR makes 
with OX. 

Let P be any point, whose co- 
ordinates are x and y, lying on AB ', 
draw the ordinate PM, and also ML 
perpendicular to OR and PN perpen- 
dicular to ML. 




THE STRAIGHT LINE. 85 

Then OL = OMco^a (1), 

and LR = NP = MF&amp;inNMP. 

But lNMP^W - lNMO= iMOL^a. 

LR = MP&amp;m.a (2). 

Hence, adding (1) and (2), we have 

Oil/ cos a + ifPsin a=OL + LR=OR =79, 
i.e. X COS a + y sin a = p. 

This is the required equation. 

54. In Arts. 47 — 53 we have found that the correspond- 
ing equations are only of the first degree in x and y. We 
shall now prove that 

Any equation of the first degree i7i x and y always repre- 
sents a straight line. 

For the most general form of such an equation is 

Ax + By^C = ^ (1), 

where A^ B, and C are constants, i.e. quantities which do 
not contain x and y and which remain the same for all 
points on the locus. 

Let (cCi, 2/1), (a?2) 2/2)) ^iicl (rt's, 2/3) be any three points on 
the locus of the equation (1). 

Since the point {x-^, y^) lies on the locus, its coordinates 
when substituted for x and y in (1) must satisfy it. 

Hence Ax^ + Ry^+C-=0 (2). 

So Ax^ + Ry^ + C^O (3), 

and Axs + £ys+C = (4). 

Since these three equations hold between the three quanti- 
ties A, B, and C, we can, as in Art. 12, eliminate them. 

The result is 

^35 2/35 -•- 

But, by Art. 25, the relation (5) states that the area of the 
triangle whose vertices are (x^, y^), (x^, 3/2)5 ^^^ (^3&gt; 2/3) is 
zero. 

Also these are any three points on the locus. 

3—2 



= (5). 



36 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The locus must therefore be a straight line ; for a curved 
line could not be such that the triangle obtained by joining 
any three points on it should be zero. 

55. The proposition of the preceding article may also be deduced 

from Art. 47. For the equation 

^a; + % + (7=0 

A C 
may be written y=- — x-^, 

and this is the same as the straight line 

y = mx + c, 

A ^ C 

if ?3i=-— and c = - — . 

x&gt; is 

But in Art. 47 it was shewn that y = mx + c was the equation to 
a straight line cutting off an intercept c from the axis of y and 
inclined at an angle tan~^m to the axis of x. 

The equation Ax + By + C=0 

C 

therefore represents a straight line cutting off an intercept - — from 

x&gt; 

the axis of y and inclined at an angle tan~^ ( - — | to the axis of x. 

56. We can reduce the general equation of the first 
degree Ax + By + C = (1) 

to the form of Art. 53. 

For, if p be the perpendicular from the origin on (1) 
and a the angle it makes with the axis, the equation to the 
straight line must be 

X cos a 4- 2/ sin a - /» = (2). 

This equation must therefore be the same as (1). 
cos a sin a —p 



Hence

Hence 

-A . -B ^ C 

cos a - - , sm a = , , and p = 



s/A^ + B^' \fA-' + B'' sfA^ + B^ 

The equation (1) may therefore be reduced to the form (2) 
by dividing it by JA^ + B^ and arranging it so that the 
constant term is negative. 



THE STRAIGHT LINE. 37 

57. Ex. Reduce to tlie perpendicular form the equation 

^ + 2/\/3 + 7 = (1). 

Here JA'' + B^= ^TTs = sJ4:=2. 

Dividing (1) by 2, we have 

i.e. ^(-i)+y(--^)-i=o, 

i.e. X cos 240° + y sin 240° - 1 = 0. 

58. To trace the straight line given hy an equation of 
the first degree. 

Let the equation be 

Ax + By + G = (1). 

(a) This can be written in the form 

A B 

Comparing this with the result of Art. 50, we see that it 

(J 

represents a straight Hne which cuts off intercepts — -^ and 


— — from the axes. Its position is therefore known. 

jO 

If G be zero, the equation (1) reduces to the form 

A 

and thus (by Art. 47, Cor.) represents a straight hne 
passing through the origin inchned at an angle tan~^ I ~ r ) 
to the axis of x. Its position is therefore known. 

(^) The straight line may also be traced by firnding 
the coordinates of any two points on it.

If we put y — in (1) we have x — —-r. The point

therefore lies on it.

Hence, as before, we have the position of the straight 



69. Ex. Trace the straight lines 

(1) 3a;-4i/ + 7 = 0; (2) 7a; + 8y + 9 = 0j 
(3) %y = x', (4) x = ^i (5) 2/= -2. 




(1) Putting 2/ = 0, we have rc= -|, 

and putting x = Q, we have y = ^. 

Measuring 0A-^{= -^) along the axis of x we have one point on 
the Hne. 

Measuring OB^ (=t) along the axis of y we have another point. 
Hence A-^B^ , produced both ways, is the required line, 

(2) Putting in succession y and x equal to zero, we have the 
intercepts on the axes equal to - f and - f. 

If then 0-42= -f and 0^2= - |, we have A^B^, the required line. 

(3) The point (0, 0) satisfies the equation so that the origin is on 
the line. 

Also the point (3, 1), i.e. C.^, lies on it. The required line is 
therefore OC3. 

(4) The line ic = 2 is, by Art. 46, parallel to the axis of y and passes 
through the point A^ on the axis of x such that 0A^ = 2. 

(5) The line y= - 2 is parallel to the axis of x and passes through 
the point B^ on the axis of y, such that 0B^= - 2. 

60. Straight Line at Infinity. We have seen 
that the equation Ax + By + (7 = represents a straight line 



STRAIGHT LINE JOINING TWO POINTS. 39 

c c 

which cuts oiF intercepts — - and — — from the axes of 

Ji. Jj 

coordinates. 

If A vanish, but not B or C, the intercept on the axis 
of X is infinitely great. The equation of the straight line 
then reduces to the form y = constant, and hence, as in 
Art. 46, represents a straight line parallel to Ox. 

So if B vanish, but not A or C, the straight line meets 
the axis of y at an infinite distance and is therefore parallel 
to it. 

If A and B both vanish, but not C, these two in- 
tercepts are both infinite and therefore the straight line 
Q .x + .y + C = is altogether at infinity. 

61. The multiplication of an equation by a constant 
does not alter it. Thus the equations 

2a;-32/+5 = and 10a;- 152/+ 25 - 

represent the same straight line. 

Conversely, if two equations of the first degree repre- 
sent the same straight line, one equation must be equal to 
the other multiplied by a constant quantity, so that the 
ratios of the corresponding coefficients must be the same. 

For example, if the equations 

a^x + \y + Ci = and A-^^x + B^y + Cj = 
we must have 

«! \ CjL 

62. To jind the equation to the straight line which 
passes through the two given points {x\ y') and (x", y"). 

By Art. 47, the equation to any straight line is 

y-- mx -VG (1). 

By properly determining the quantities m and c we can 
make (1) represent any straight line we please. 

If (1) pass through the point (a;', y')^ we have 

2/' = mas' + c (2). 

Substituting for c from (2), the equation (1) becomes 

y-y' = m(x-x') (3). 



40 COOKDINATE GEOMETRY. 

This is the equation to the line going through (x\ y') making 
an angle tan~^ m with OX. If in addition (3) passes through 
the point {x", y"), then 

y —y=m{x — x), 

ti r 

y -y 



* * X' - X 

Substituting this value in (3), we get as the required 
equation 

V" — v' 
*^ X" — x^ ' 

63. Ex. Find the equation to the straight line which passes 
through the points (-1, 3) and (4, -2). 

Let the required equation be 

y=mx + c (1). 

Since (1) goes through the first point, we have 
3=-m + c, so that c = m + S. 
Hence (1) becomes 

y = mx + m + S (2). 

If in addition the line goes through the second point, we have 

-2 = 47?i + m + 3, so that m= -1. 
Hence (2) becomes 

y=-x + 2, i.e. x + y = 2. 
Or, again, using the result of the last article the equation is 

y-B = ^-^^^{x + l)=-x-l, 

i.e. y + x-=2. 

64. To fix definitely the position of a straight line we 
must have always two quantities given. Thus one point 
on the straight line and the direction of the straight line 
will determine it; or again two points lying on the straight 
line will determine it. 

Analytically, the general equation to a straight line 
will contain two arbitrary constants, which will have to be 
determined so that the general equation may represent any 
particular straight line. 

Thus, in Art. 47, the quantities m and c which remain 
the same, so long as we are considering the same straigld 
line, are the two constants for the straight line. 



EXAMPLES. 41 

Similarly, in Art. 50, the quantities a and h are the 
constants for the straight line. 

65. In any equation to a locus the quantities x and y, 
which are the coordinates of any point on the locus, are 
called Current Coordinates ; the curve may be conceived as 
traced out by a point which " runs " along the locus.

the perpendiculars from the origin make angles a and p 
with the axis of x. 

Now that angle between two straight lines, in which 
the origin lies, is the supplement of the angle between the 
perpendiculars, and the angle between these perpendiculars 
is ^ — a. 

[For, if OEi and OR2 be the perpendiculars from the origin upon 
the two hnes, then the points O, R^, R^, and A lie on a circle, and 
hence the angles R^OR^ and R.^AR^ are either equal or supplementary.] 



44 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

67. To find the condition that two straight lines may 
he parallel. 

Two straight lines are parallel when the angle between 
them is zero and therefore the tangent of this angle is zero. 

The equation (2) of the last article then gives 

Two straight lines whose equations are given in the 
"m" form are therefore parallel when their "7?i's" are the 
same, or, in other words, if their equations differ only in 
the constant term. 

The straight line Ax + By + G' = is any straight line which is 
parallel to the straight line Ax + By + C = 0. For the "m's" of the 
two equations are the same. 

Again the equation A {x-x')+B {y-y') = clearly represents the 
straight line which passes through the point {x', y') and is parallel to 
Ax + By + C=0. 

The result (3) of the last article gives, as the condition 
for parallel lines, 

68. Ex. Find the equation to the straight line, which passes 
through the point (4, - 5), and which is parallel to the straight line 

3:c + 4r/ + 5--=0 (1). 

Any straight line which is parallel to (1) has its equation of the 
form 

3a; + 4^/ + (7=0 (2). 

[For the "w" of both (1) and (2) is the same.] 

This straight line will pass through the point (4, - 5) if 
3x4 + 4x(-5) + C = 0, 
i.e. if (7=20-12 = 8. 

The equation (2) then becomes 

3a;+42/ + 8 = 0. 

69. To find the condition that two st^'aight lines j whose 
equations are given, may he 'perpendicular. 

Let the straight lines be 

y — m^x -i-Ci, 

and y — m.^x -\- G.2_. 



CONDITIONS OF PERPENDICULARITY. 45 

If be the angle between them we have, by Art. 66, 

tan^^ r^""^^ (1). 

1 +mim2 

If the lines be perpendicular, then ^ = 90°, and therefore 
tan = 00 . 

The right-hand member of equation (1) must therefore 
be infinite, and this can only happen when its denominator 
is zero. 

The condition of perpendicularity is therefore that 

1 + m^TTi^ — O, i.e. Tn-^Tn2 = — I.' 

The straight line y — tu^x + c.^ is therefore perpendicular 

to y = »...H-.c., if «, = -!. 

y/c'-t 

It follows that the straight lines 

A^x +B^y + C^ = and A^x + B^y + 0^ = 0, 



for which m^ = — ^ and m^^ — ^ , are at right angles if 

a) V A 



AA / A,, _ 



i.e. a A^A^+B^B^ = 0. 

70. From the preceding article it follows that the two 
straight lines 

A^x + B,y + Ci = Q (1), 

and B,x-A,y+C^ = (2), 

are at right angles ; for the product of their m's 

Also (2) is derived from (1) by interchanging the coefficients 
of a; and y, changing the sign of one of them, and changing 
the constant into any other constant. 

Ex. The straight line through (x', y') perpendicular to (1) is (2) 
where B^x' - A-^y' + 62= 0, so that Cg = A^y'- B^x'. 

This straight line is therefore 

B,{x-x')-A^{y-y') = 0. 



46 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

71. Ex. 1. Find the equation to the straight line which passes 
through the point (4, —5) and is perpendicular to the straight line 

Sx + 4ij + 5 = (1). 

First Method. Any straight line perpendicular to (1) is by the 
last article 

4:X-Sij + C=0 (2). 

[We should expect an arbitrary constant in (2) because there are 
an infinite number of straight lines perpendicular to (1).] 
The straight line (2) passes through the point (4, - 5) if 
4x4-3x(-5) + C = 0, 
i.e. a (7= -16-15= -31. 

The required equation is therefore 

4:X-Sy = 31. 
Second Method. Any straight line passing through the given 
point is 

y -{-5)=m{x~4:). 

This straight line is perpendicular to (1) if the product of their 
m's is - 1, 
i.e. if m X ( - 1) = - 1, 

i.e. if m=|. 

The required equation is therefore 

y + 5=i{x-4), 
i.e. 4:X-'6y = Sl. 

Third Method. Any straight line is y=mx + c. It passes through 
the point (4, - 5), if 

-5 = 4m + c (3). 

It is perpendicular to (1) if 

mx{-i)=-l (4). 

Hence m = f and then (3) gives c = — V. 

The required equation is therefore y = '^x-^-^, 
i.e. 4x-By = Sl. 

[In the first method, we start with any straight line which is 
perpendicular to the given straight line and pick out that particular 
straight line which goes through the given point. 

In the second method, we start with any straight line passing 
through the given point and pick out that particular one which is 
perpendicular to the given straight hne. 

In the third method, we start with any straight line whatever and 
determine its constants, so that it may satisfy the two given 
conditions. 

The student should illustrate by figures. ] 

Ex. 2. Find the equation to the straight line which passes through 
the point (x', y') and is perpendicular to the given straight line 

yy' = 2a {x + x'). 



THE STRAIGHT LINE. 47 

The given straight line is 

yy' - 2ax - 2ax' = 0. 

Any straight line perpendicular to it is (Art. 70) 

2ay + xy'+G=0 (1). 

This will pass through the point (x', y') and therefore will be the 
straight line required if the coordinates x' and y' satisfy it, 

i.eAt 2ai/ + xY+C = 0, 

i.e. if G=-2ay' -x'y'. 

Substituting in (1) for G the required equation is therefore 

2a{y-y') + y'{x-x') = 0. 

72. To find the equations to the straight lines which 
pass through a given point (x', t/') and make a given angle a 
with the given straight line y — nix + c. 

Let P be the given point and let the given straight line 
be LMJSf, making an angle 
with the axis of x such that 

tan = m. 

In general (i.e. except when 
a is a right angle or zero) there 
are two straight lines PMR and 
FNS making an angle a with 
the given line. 

Let these lines meet the axis of x in R and S and let 
them make angles ^ and &lt;^' with the positive direction of 
the axis of x. 

The equations to the two required straight lines are 
therefore (by Art. 62) 

y -y' = tan ^ x (x — x) (1), 

and y ~y' ~ t^^ &lt;fi' X (x — x') (2). 

Now cf, = L LMR + L RLM = a + 6*, 

and &lt;^'^L LNS+ L SLN= (180° ^a) + e. 

Hence

Through P draw P^, parallel to

50 COORDINATE GEOMETKY. 

Now, by (1), 

The point {x ^ y') is therefore on one side or the other of 
LM according as the quantity Ax' + By' + C is negative or 
positive. 

Cor. The point (cc', y') and the origin are on the same 
side of the given line if Ax + By + G and AxO-\- B xO + C 
have the same signs, i.e. if Ax' + By' + C has the same sign 
as C. 

If these two quantities have opposite signs, then the 
origin and the point (x, y') are on opposite sides of the 
given line. 

!74. The condition that two points may lie on the 
same or opposite sides of a given line may also be obtained 
by considering the ratio in which the line joining the two 
points is cut by the given line. 

For let the equation to the given line be 

Ax + By-¥C=0 (1), 

and let the coordinates of the two given points be [x-^, y^ 
and (a?2, 2/2)- 

The coordinates of the point which divides in the ratio

and (x^, 2/2), i.e. if these two points be on opposite sides of 
the given line, the ratio in-^ : 711^ is positive. 

In this case, by (3) the two quantities Ax^ + By^ + C 
and Ax^ + By^ + C have opposite signs. 

The two points (a?i, y^ and {x^^ y^) therefore lie on the op-

(i) Let the equation of the straight line be 

£CCOSa+ 2/ sin a — p = (1), 

so that, if p be the perpendicular on it, we have 
ON^p and lXON=^o.. 

Let the given point F be {x ^ y'). 

Through P draw PR parallel to the given line to meet 
OiV produced in R and draw PQ the required perpendicular. 
If OR be 2^'i the equation to PR is, by Art. 53, 

X cos a + 2/ ^^^ ^ ~P' — ^• 
Since this passes through the point {x, y\ we have 

£c' cos a + 2/' sin a.—p' = 0, 
so that p = x' cos a + 2/' sin a. 

But the required perpendicular 

^PQ = NR = OR-ON = p'-p 

= X' cos a + y' sin a — p (2). 

The length of the required perpendicular is therefore 
obtained by substituting x and y for x and y in the given 
equation. 

(ii) Let the equation to the straight line be 

Ax + By + G=^0 (3), 

the equation being written so that (7 is a negative quantity.

54 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. [EXS. VII.l 

11. Find the perpendicular distance from the origin of the 
perpendicular from the point (1, 2) upon the straight line 

77. To find the coordinates of the foint of intersection 
of two given straight lines. 

Let the equations of the two straight lines be 

a-^x + h{y + Ci = (1), 

and fta^^ + 522/ + ^2 = {2)5 

and let the straight lines be AL^ and AL^ as in the figure 
of Art. 66. 

Since (1) is the equation of AL^^ the coordinates of any 
point on it must satisfy the equation (1). So the coordi- 
nates of any point on AL^ satisfy equation (2). 

Now the only point which is common to these two 
straight lines is their point of intersection A. 

The coordinates of this point must therefore satisfy 
both (1) and (2). 

If therefore A be the point {x^, t/i)? ^^ have 

«ia^i + ^i2/i + Ci = (3), 

and a2^i + 522/i + &lt;^2 = W- 

Solving (3) and (4) we have (as in Art. 3) 

^x ^ 2/1 ^ \__ 

so that the coordinates of the required common point are 

h-fi^ — h.^c^ - c^a^ — c^a^ 
a^^-ajb^ a-}&gt;&lt;^—a^^ 

78. The coordinates of the point of intersection found 
in the last article are infinite if 

a^^ — a^hi = 0. 

But from Art. 67 we know that the two straight lines 
are parallel if this condition holds. 

Hence parallel lines must be looked upon as lines whose 
point of intersection is at an infinite distance. 



CONCUKEENCE OF STRAIGHT LINES. 55 

79. To find the condition that three straight lines may 
ineet in a point. 

Let their equations be 

a^x + hyy + c^ = (1), 

a.jX + h^y + C2 = (2), 

and a.p: + h-^y + C3 = (3). 

By Art. 77 the coordinates of the point of intersection 
of (1) and (2) are 

—r -J- and —jf J-- (4). 

If the three straight lines meet in a point, the point of 
intersection of (1) and (2) must lie on (3). Hence the 
values (4) must satisfy (3), so that 

0-iCn — Oc\C-\ -t C-\Cto C.-^Cti - 

«3 X -^r — T- + ^3 X -V — ~-Y + C3 = 0, 

i. e. a^ (b^c^ — b^c-^) + 63 (ci^g — 02%) + c^ (a^b^ — a^bj) — 0, 

i. e. ai (b^c^ — b^c^) + b^ {c^a^ — c^a^ + Cj (^2^3 — ^3^2) = . . , (5). 

Aliter. If, the three straight lines meet in a point let 
it be (ccj, 2/1), so that the values x\ and y-^ satisfy the 
equations (1), (2), and (3), and hence 

a-^x-^ + 6i2/i + Ci = 0, 

ftoa^i + b^yi + C2 = 0, 
and a^x-^ + b^y^ + Cg = 0. 

The condition that these three equations should hold 
between the two quantities x^ and y^ is, as in Art. 12, 

^3 J ^3 ) &lt;^3 

which is the same as equation (5). 

80. Another criterion as to whether the three straight 
lines of the previous article meet in a point is the following. 

If any three quantities ^p, q, and r can be found so 
that 
p (ajX + b^y + C;^) + q (a^x + b.2y + c^) + r (a^x + b^y + Cg) = 

identically, then the three straight lines meet in a point. 



56 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

For in this case we have 

a^x + h^y + Cg =: — - (a-^x + h^y + Cj) — - {a^x + h^y + Co) . • •(!). 

Now the coordinates of the point of intersection of the 
first two of the lines make the right-hand side of (1) vanish. 
Hence the same coordinates make the left-hand side vanish. 
The point of intersection of the first two therefore satisfies 
the equation to the third line and all three therefore meet 
in a point. 

81. Ex. 1. Shew that the three straight lines 2«-3i/ + 5 = 0, 
dx + ^y -1 = 0, and 9a; -5y 4- 8 = meet in a point. 

If we multiply these three equations by 6, 2, and - 2 we have 
identically 

6 (2x - 32/ + 5) + 2 (3x -I- 4t/ - 7) - 2 (9a; - 5?/ -F 8) = 0. 

The coordinates of the point of intersection of the first two lines 
make the first two brackets of this equation vanish and hence make 
the third vanish. The common point of intersection of the first two 
therefore satisfies the third equation. The three straight lines 
therefore meet in a point. 

Ex. 2. Prove that the three 'perpendiculars draicn from the 
vertices of a triangle upon the opposite sides all meet in a point. 
Let the triangle be ABC and let its angular points be the points 

K,2/i). (^2 '2/2)5 and (x^^ys)- 
The equation to BG is y-y^ = "^ — - {x - x^). 
The equation to the perpendicular from A on this straight line is 



x^ x^ 



i'^' 2/ (2/3 -2/2) + ^(^3 -^2) =2/1 (1/3 -2/2) +^1(^3 -^2) (!)• 

So the perpendiculars from B and C on CA and AB are 

2/(2/i-2/3)+^(aa-^3) = 2/2(2/i-2/3)+«'2{^i-^3) (2). 

and 2/ (2/2 -2/]) + ^(^2-^1) =2/3 (2/2 -2/1) + ^3 (^2-^1) (3). 

On adding these three equations their sum identically vanishes. 
The straight lines represented by them therefore meet in a point. 

This point is called the ortliocentre of the triangle. 

82. To Jind the equation to any straight line which 
2)asses through the intersection of the two straight lines 

a-^x + \y + c-^ = (1)&gt; 

and a^x + b^y + Cg = (2). 



INTERSECTIONS OF STRAIGHT LINES. 57 

If (a?i, 2/1) be the common point of the equations (1) 
and (2) we may, as in Art. 77, find the values of x^ and 2/1, 
and then the equation to any straight line through it is 

where m is any quantity whatever. 

Aliter. If A be the common point of the two straight 
lines, then both equations (1) and (2) are satisfied by the 
coordinates of the point A. 

Hence the equation 

a-^x + h^y + Ci + X {a,^x + h^y + Co) = (3) 

is satisfied by the coordinates of the common point A, 
where \ is any arbitrary constant. 

But (3), being of the first degree in x and y, always 
represents a straight line. 

It therefore represents a straight line passing through A . 

Also the arbitrary constant X may be so chosen that (3) 
may fulfil any other condition. It therefore represents 
any straight line passing through A. 

83. Ex. Find the equation to the straight line ivhich passes 
through the intersection of the straight lines 

2x-Sy + 4: = 0, Sx + ^y-5 = (1), 

and is perpendicular to the straight line 

Gx-7y + 8 = (2). 

Solving the equations (1), the coordinates x^^, 7/1 of their common 
point are given by 

^1 ^ yi _ 1 _ 1 

(-3)(-5)-4x4 4x3-2x(-5) 2x4-3x(-3) ^^' 

so that x-^= - yY and 2/1 =Tf- 

The equation of any straight line through this common point is 
therefore 

y-H=m{x + ^). 

This straight line is, by Art. 69, perpendicular to (2) if 

m X f = - 1, i.e. if mr= - |. 
The required equation is therefore 

i.e. 119a; + 1022/ = 125. 



58 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



Aliter. Any straight line through the intersection of the straight 
lines (1) is 

i.e. (2 + 3X)a; + ?/(4X-3) + 4-5X = (3). 

This straight line is perpendicular to (2), if 

6(2 + 3X)-7(4X-3) = 0, (Art. 69) 

i.e. a \ = u. 

* 
The equation (3) is therefore 

i.e. 119a; +102?/ -125 = 0. 

Bisectors of angles between straight lines. 

84. To find the equations of the bisectors of the angles 
between the straight lines 

ajpc + b-yy + Cj^ = (1), 

and a^ + b^ + c^ = (2). 




Let the two straight lines be AL^ and AL^, and let the 
bisectors of the angles between them be AM^ and A^f^- 

Let P be any point on either of these bisectors and 
draw PiVi and FJV^ perpendicular to the given lines. 

The triangles PAN-^ and PAN&lt;^ are equal in all respects, 
so that the perpendiculars PN^ and PN^ ^-re equal in 
magnitude. 

Let the equations to the straight lines be written 
so that Ci and c^ are both negative, and to the quantities 

Ja^ + b^ and Ja^ + b^ let the positive sign be prefixed. 



EQUATIONS TO BISECTOKS OF ANGLES. 59 

If P be the point (/i, k), the numerical values of PN^ 
and PN^ are (by Art. 75) 

aJh + hJc + c. , aji + hjc + c^ , , 

— ,_ and — . (1). 

If P lie on AM^^ i.e. on the bisector of the angle 
between the two straight lines in which the origin lies, the 
point P and the origin lie on the same side of each of the 
two lines. Hence (by Art. 73, Cor.) the two quantities (1) 
have the same sign as c^ and c^ respectively. 

In this case, since c^ and c^ have the same sign, the 
quantities (1) have the same sign, and hence 
aji + hjc + Ci aji + hjc + c^ 

But this is the condition that the point (h, k) may lie on 
the straight line 

a^x + h-{y + Cj a^ + h^y + c^ 

which is therefore the equation to AM-^. 

If, however, P lie on the other bisector AM^, the two 
quantities (1) will have opposite signs, so that the equation 
to AM^ will be 

a-^x + \y + Ci a^x + })c^y + c^ 

The equations to the original lines being therefore 
arranged so that the constant terms are both positive (or 
both negative) the equation to the bisectors is 

VS7+b7 - Vi7+bp ' 

the upper sign giving the bisector of the angle in which 
the origin lies. 

85. Ex. Find the equations to the bisectors of the angles 
between the straight lines 

3x-4:y + 7 = and 12x-5y-S = 0. 
Writing the equations so that their constant terms are both 
positive they are 

Sx-Ay + 7 = and -12x + 5y + 8 = 0. 



60 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



t.e. 
i.e. 



The equation to the bisector of the angle in which the origin lies 
is therefore 

Bx-^y + 7 _ -12x + 5y + 8 

i.e. 13{Bx-^y + l) = 5{-12x + 5y + 8), 

i.e. 99a; -772/ + 51 = 0. 

The equation to the other bisector is 

Sx-iy + l _ - 12x + 5?/ + 8 
V32 + 42 ~ ~ x/122 + 52 ' 
13 {3a; - 4?/ + 7) + 5 ( - 12a; + 5?/ + 8) = 0, 
21a: + 272/- 131 = 0. 

86. It will be found useful in a later chapter to have 
the equation to a straight line, which passes through a 
given point and makes a given angle 6 with a given line, in 
a form different from that of Art. 62. 

Let A be the given point {h, k) and L'AL a straight 
line through it inclined at an 
angle 6 to the axis of x. 

Take any point F, whose 
coordinates are (x, y), lying on 
this line, and let the distance 
AP be r. 

Draw PM perpendicular 
to the axis of x and AN perpendicular to PM. 

Then x--h=- AN = AP cosO=r cos 6, 

and y — k = NP - AP sin ^ = r sin 0. 

x-h y-k 




Hence 



= r 



.(1). 



This being the relation holding between the coordinates 
of any point P on the line is the equation required. 

Cor. From (1) we have 

x — h + r cos 6 and y = k + r sin 0. 

The coordinates of any point on the given line are 

therefore h-\-r cos 6 and k + r sin 0. 

87. To find the length of the straight line drawn 
through a given point in a given direction to meet a given 
straight line. 



EXAMPLES. 61 

Let the given straight line be 

Ax-¥By + C^Q (1). 

Let the given point A be (7t, k) and the given direction 
one making an angle 6 with the axis of x. 

Let the line drawn through A meet the straight line 
(1) in P and let AP be r. 

By the corollary to the last article the coordinates 
of P are 

h + r cos 6 and k + r sin 6. 

Since these coordinates satisfy (1) we have 
^ (A + r cos ^) + ^ (^ + r sin ^) + (7 - 0.

A cos 6 ■¥ B sin 6 
giving the length AP which is required. 

Cor. From the preceding may be deduced the length 
of the perpendicular drawn from (A, k) upon (1). 

For the "m" of the straight line drawn through A is 

tan ^ and the "m" of (1) is - -. 

This straight line is perpendicular to (1) if 

tan y. { — ^\ = — \,

POLAR EQUATIONS. OBLIQUE COORDINATES. 

MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS. LOCI. 

88. To find the general equation to a straight line in 
polar coordinates. 

Let p be the length of the perpendicular Y from the 
origin upon the straight line, and 
let this perpendicular make an 
angle a with the initial line. 

Let P be any point on the 
line and let its coordinates be r 
and 6. 

The equation required will 
then be the relation between r, 6, p, and a. 
From the triangle YP we have 

p = r cos YOP = rcos{a-6)=^r cos (6 - a). 
The required equation is therefore 
r cos (6 — a) =p. 

[On transforming to Cartesian coordinates this equation becomes 
the equation of Art. 53.] 

89. To find the polar equation of the straight line 
joining the poiiits whose coordinates are (r^, 6^) and {r^, 6^. 




THE STRAIGHT LINE. OBLIQUE COORDINATES. 67 



Let A and B be the two given points and P any point 
on the line joining them 
whose coordinates are r and 

e. 

Then, since 
AA0B-=AA0P+A POB, 
we have

sin (^,-^i) _ sin ((9-^1) sin ((92-^) 



OBLIQUE COORDINATES. 

90. In the previous chapter we took the axes to be 
rectangular. In the great majority of cases rectangular 
axes are employed, but in some cases oblique axes may be 
used with advantage. 

In the following articles we shall consider the proposi- 
tions in which the results for oblique axes are different 
from those for rectangular axes. The propositions of Arts. 
50 and 62 are true for oblique, as well as rectangular, 
coordinates. 

91. To find the equation to a straight line referred to 
axes inclined at an angle w. 



Let LPL' be a straight line which cuts the axis of 
a distance c from the origin and is 
inclined at an angle to the axis 
of X. 

Let P be any point on the 
straight line. Draw PNM parallel 
to the axis of y to meet OX in M^ 
and let it meet the . straight line 
through C parallel to the axis of x 
in the point N, 

Let P be the point (.r, y\ so that

Cor. From. (1), by putting in succession equal to 90° 
and 90° + o), we see that the equations to the straight lines, 
passing through the origin and perpendicular to the axes of 

X and y, are respectively y = and y = —x cos w. 

92. The axes being oblique, to find the equation to the 
straight line, such that the 'perpendicular on it from the origin 
is of length p and makes angles a and ^ with the axes of x 
and y. 

Let LM be the given straight line and OK the perpen- 
dicular on it from the origin. 

Let P be any point on the 
straight line ; draw the ordinate 
PN and draw NP perpendicular 
to OK and PS "oerpendicular to 
NR. 

Let P be the point {x, y), so 
that OJV = X and NP = y. 




THE STRAIGHT LINE. OBLIQUE COORDINATES. 69 

The lines NP and Y are parallel. 

Also OK and SP are parallel, each being perpendicular 
to NB. 

Thus lSPN^lKOM=^. 

We therefore have 
'p = OK- OR + SP = OiVcos a + NP cos p=^xcosa + y cos ^. 

Hence x cos a + y cos /5 — p = 0, 

being the relation which holds between the coordinates of 
any point on the straight line, is the required equation. 

93. To find the angle between the straight lines 
y = mx + c and y = mx + c, 
the axes being oblique.

Substituting these values in the result of the last article 
the angle between the two lines is easily found to be

AA' + BB' - {AB' + A'B) cos w 

The given lines are therefore parallel if 

A'B-AB'=^0. 

They are perpendicular if 

AA' + BB' = {AB' + A'B) cos w. 

95. Ex. The axes being inclined at an angle of 30°, obtain the 
equations to the straight lines ivhich pass through the origin and are 
inclined at 45° to the straight line x + y = l. 

Let either of the required straight lines be y = mx. 
The given straight line isy= -x + 1, so that m'= - 1. 
We therefore have 

1 + (m + m') cos &lt;a + mm' 

where m'= - 1 and w = 30°.

This equation gives 2 + (,,,_ 1)^3- 2m = "^^^ 

Taking the upper sign we obtain m= — j^. 

Taking the lower sign we have m = - ^3.

Find also the coordinates of the centres of the escribed

Let ABC be the triangle and let AD and CE be the

Then 0' is the required point.

The point D therefore divides BG in the ratio

relations which hold between x, y\ A, and k. 

Also li and k are the quantities which by their variation 
cause Q to take up different positions. If therefore between 
(1), (2), and (3) we eliminate h and k we shall obtain a 
relation between x and y which is true for all values' of h 
and k^ i. e. a relation which is true whatever be the position 
that P takes on the given straight line. 

From (2) and (3), by solving, we have 

k ^ 2(a3^-y^cosco ) ^^^ ^ ^ 2 {y' - x' cos co) ^ 
sin^ 00 sin^ co 

Substituting these values in (1), we obtain 

2 A {x' - y' cos co) + 2^ {y — x cos co) + C sin^ co == 0. 

But this is the condition that the point (cc', y) shall 
always lie on the straight line 

2A{x-y cos oi) + '2£ {y — X cos co) + C sin^ co - 0, 
i. e. on the straight line 

x{A — £ cos (j&gt;) + y {£ — A cos co) + J C sin- co = 0, 
which is therefore the equation to the locus of Q. 

104. Ex. A straight line is drawn jjarallel to the 
base of a given triangle and its extremities are joined trans- 
versely to those of the base; find the locus of the 2&gt;oint 
of intersection of the joining lines. 



THE STRAIGHT LINE. PROBLEMS. 



83 



Let the triangle be OAB and take as the origin and 
the directions of OA and OB 
as the axes of x and y. 

Let OA = a and OB = 6, 
so that a and h are given 
quantities. 

Let A'B' be the straight 
line which is parallel to the 
base ABj so that 

OA ~~0B 

and hence OA' = \a and OB' — Xb. 

For different values of X we therefore have different 
positions of A'B'. 

The equation to AB' is 




X (say), 



and that to A'B is 



- + — = 1 
a Xb

(2)- 



Since F is the intersection of AB' and A'B its coordi- 
nates satisfy both (1) and (2). Whatever equation we 
derive from them must therefore denote a locus going 
through P. Also if we derive from (1) and (2) an equation 
which does not contain X, it must represent a locus which 
passes through P whatever be the value of A.; in other 
words it must go through all the different positions of the 
point P. 

Subtracting (2) from (1), we have

But this is the condition that the point {h, A), i.e. P, 
should lie on the straight line

The straight line is therefore the required locus.

a given point to cut two fixed straight lines in R and S ; 
on it is taken a j)oint P such that

shew that the locus of P is a third fixed straight livie. 

Take any two fixed straight lines, at right angles and 
passing through 0, as the axes and let the equation to the 
two given fixed straight lines be 

Ax + By + C=0, 

and A'x + B'y + G' = 0.

CHAPTER VI. 

ON EQUATIONS REPRESENTING TWO OR MORE 
STRAIGHT LINES. 

106. Suppose we have to trace the locus represented 
by the equation 

2/2_3a;2/ + 2a;2 = (1). 

This equation is equivalent to 

{y-x){y-2x) = (2). 

It is satisfied by the coordinates of all points which 
make the first of these brackets equal to zero, and also by 
the coordinates of all points which make the second 
bracket zero, i.e. by all the points which satisfy the 
equation 

2/-^ = (3), 

and also by the points which satisfy 

y-2x = (4). 

But, by Art. 47, the equation (3) represents a straight 
line passing through the origin, and so also does equa- 
tion (4). 

Hence equation (1) represents the two straight lines 
which pass through the origin, and are inclined at angles of 
45° and tan~^ 2 respectively to the axis of x. 

107. Ex. 1. Trace the locus xy = 0. This equation 
is satisfied by all the points which satisfy the equation 
x — O and by all the points which satisfy y — 0, i. e. by 
all the points which lie either on the axis of y or on the 
axis of X. 



EQUATIONS EEPRESENTING STRAIGHT LINES. 89 

The required locus is therefore the two axes of coordi- 
nates. 

Elx. 2. Trace the locus x^ — hx+ &amp;=^ 0. This equation 
is equivalent to {x — 2) (a; — 3) = 0. It is therefore satisfied 
by all points which satisfy the equation a; — 2 = and also 
by all the points which satisfy the equation a? — 3 = 0. 

But these equations represent two straight lines which 
are parallel to the axis of y and are at distances 2 and 3 
respectively from the origin (Art. 46). 

Ex. 3. Trace the locus xy - ix — by ■¥ 'lO = 0. This 
equation is equivalent to {x — 5) (2/ — 4) = 0, and therefore 
represents a straight line parallel to the axis of y at a 
distance 5 and also a straight line parallel to the axis of x 
at a distance 4. 

108. Let us consider the general equation 

ax^ + 2hxy + hy'^ ^ (1). 

On multiplying it by a it may be written in the form 
(«2x.2 + 2ahxy + hhf) - (A^ - ah) y'^ = 0, 

L e. \{ax + hy) + y Jh^ — ab\ {(ax + hy) — y Jh^ — ab\ = 0. 

As in the last article the equation (1) therefore repre- 
sents the two straight lines whose equations are 

ax + hy + y Jh^ — ab = (2), 

and ax + hy — y J li^ — ab = (3), 

each of which passes through the origin. 

For (1) is satisfied by all the points which satisfj'- (2), 
and also by all the points which satisfy (3), 

These two straight lines are real and different if h^&gt;ab, 
real and coincident if h^ = ah, and imaginary if h^&lt;ab. 

[For in the latter case the coefiicient of y in each of the 
equations (2) and (3) is partly real and partly imaginary.] 

In the case when h^ &lt; ab, the straight lines, though 
themselves imaginary, intersect in a real point. For the 
origin lies on the locus given by (1), since the equation (1) 
is always satisfied by the values x = and y = 0. 



90 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

109. An equation such as (1) of the previous article, 
which is such that in each term the sum of the indices of x 
and y is the same, is called a homogeneous equation. This 
equation (1) is of the second degree; for in the first term 
the index of cc is 2 ; in the second term the index of both x 
and 2/ is 1 and hence their sum is 2 ; whilst in the third 
term the index of y is 2. 

Similarly the expression 

3a^ + ix^y — 5xy'^ + 9y^ 

is a homogeneous expression of the third degree. 
The expression 

Scc^ + 4:x'^y — 5xy^ + 9y^ — 7xy 

is not however homogeneous ; for in the first four terms 
the sum of the indices is 3 in each case, whilst in the last 
term this sum is 2. 

From Art. 108 it follows that a homogeneous equation 
of the second degree represents two straight lines, real and 
different, coincident, or imaginary. 

110. The axes being rectangular, to jind the angle 
between the straight lines given by the equation 

aa? + 'ihxy + by- = (1). 

Let the separate equations to the two lines be 

y—miX = and y~ni^x — (2), 

so that (1) must be equivalent to 

b (y — mjx) (y — tUox) = (3). 

Equating the coefficients of xy and x^ in (1) and (3), we 
have 

— b {nil + ^2) = 2/i, and bm^n^ = a, 

xu i. 2h ^ a 

so that m,. + m.y = — — , ana m^m^ — -j .

Hence the required angle is found. 

111. Condition that the straight lines of the 'previous 
article may he iV) 'perpendicular, and (2) coincident. 

(1) If« + 5=:0 the value of tan ^ is cx) and hence is 
90° j the straight lines are therefore perpendicular. 

Hence two straight lines, represented by one equation, 
are at right angles if the algebraic sum of the coefficients of 
^ and 2/^ be zero. 

For example, the equations 

x^ — if = and Qx^ + llxy — 6^- — 

both represent pairs of straight lines at right angles. 

Similarly, whatever be the value of h, the equation 

a? + Ihx'y — y^ = 0, 

represents a pair of straight lines at right angles. 

(2) If h^ = ah, the value of tan is zero and hence 6 is 
zero. The angle between the straight lines is therefore 
zero and, since they both pass through the origin, they are 
therefore coincident. 

This may be seen directly from the original equation. 
For if A^ = ah, i.e. h = J ah, it may be written 

ax^ 4- '^Jah x'y + hy- =^0, 

i.e. [Jax-\- JhyY=0. 

which is two coincident straight lines.

COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



112. Tojind the equation to the straight lines bisecting 
the angle between the straight lines given by 

ax'' + 2hxy + by^ = (1). 

Let the equation (1) represent the two straight lines 




L^OM^ and LJ)M.^ inclined at angles B^ and 0.^ to the axis 
of £c, so that (1) is equivalent to 

b{y -X tan 6-^ (y - x tan 0^ = 0.

tan 6^ + tan ^o = — ;- , and tan 0^ tan 6^ — -. . .(2).

Also z ^(9X = 90° + z .4 OX.

GENERAL EQUATION OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 

114. The most general expression, which contains 
terms involving x and y in a degree not higher than the 
second, must contain terms involving x^, xy, 7/~, x, y, and a 
constant. 

The notation vv^hich is in general use for this ex- 
pression is 

aa^ + 2hxy + hy"^ + 2gx + yy + c (1). 

The quantity (1) is known as the general expression of 
the second degree, and when equated to zero is called the 
general equation of the second degree. 

The student may better remember the seemingly 
arbitrary coefficients of the terms in the expression (1) 
if the reason for their use be given. 



GENERAL EQUATION TO TWO STRAIGHT LINES. 95 

The most general expression involving terms only of 
the second degree in x, y, and z is 

aa^ + h'lf' + Gz^ + %fyz + '^gzx + Vixy (2), 

where the coefficients occur in the order of the alphabet. 

If in this expression we put ;:; equal to unity we get 
ao^ -\-hy^ + G + %fy + ^gx + 2hxy, 
which, after rearrangement, is the same as (1). 

Now in Solid Geometry we use three coordinates x, y, 
and z. Also many formulae in Plane Geometry are derived 
from those of Solid Geometry by putting z equal to unity. 

We therefore, in Plane Geometry, use that notation 
corresponding to which we have the standard notation in 
Solid Geometry. 

115. In general, as will be shewn in Chapter XV., 
the general equation represents a Curve-Locus. 

If a certain condition holds between the coefficients of 
its terms it will, however, represent a pair of straight lines. 

This condition we shall determine in the following 
article. 

116. To find the condition that the general equation 
of the second degree 

ax^ + 2hxy + hy'^ + Igx + 2/^/ + c == (1) 

Tnay rejyresent tivo straight lines. 

If we can break the left-hand members of (1) into two 
factors, each of the first degree, then, as in Art. 108, it 
will represent two straight lines. 

If a be not zero, multiply equation (1) by « and arrange 
in powers oi x; it then becomes 

a^a? + 2ax {hy + g) = — ahy^ — 2afy — ac. 
On completing the square on the left hand we have 
«V ^ 2ax {hy + g) + (hy + gf = y- {li? — ah) 

■\-2y{gh-af)^g''~-ac, 
i.e. 



{ax-\-hy+g)=^Jy''{h''-ab) + 2y{gh- of) + g^'-ac ...{2). 



96 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

From (2) we cannot obtain x in terms of y, involving 
only terms of the Jirst degree, unless the quantity under the 
radical sign be a perfect square. 

The condition for this is 

i. e. gVi^ — 2qfgh + o?f'^ = g^li? — ahg"^ — acli? + a^bc. 

Cancelling and dividing by a, we have the required 
condition, viz. 

abc + 2fgh - af 2 - bg2 - ch2 = O (3). 

117. The foregoing condition may be otherwise obtained thus : 
The given equation, multiplied by (a), is 

a?x'^-{-2ahxy + aby'^ + 2agx^-2afij + ac = (4). 

The terms of the second degree in this equation break up, as in 
Art. 108, into the factors 

ax + liy-y /Jh^-ab and ax + hy+y fjh^-ab. 
If then (4) break into factors it must be equivalent to 

{ax + {h-^JhF^ab)y + A}{ax + {h+s/h^-ab)y + B} = 0, 
where A and B are given by the relations 

a{A+B) = 2ga (5), 

A{h+ ^W^^) +B{h- ^h^ - ab) = 2fa (6), 

and AB = ac (7). 

The equations (5) and (6) give 

, , ^ 2fa-2gh 
A+B = 2g, and A - B=^^-—=A=.. 
/^/h^ — ab 

The relation (7) then gives 

Aac = 4:AB = {A+B)^-{A-By- 

~^^ ^ h^-ab ' 
i.e. {fa-ghf = {g-~ac){h^-ab), 

which, as before, reduces to 

abc + 2fgh - ap - bg"^ - cli^=^^. 

Ex. If a be zero, prove that the general equation will represent 
two straight lines if 

If both a and 6 be zero, prove that the condition is 2fg - ch~0. 



GENERAL EQUATION TO TWO STRAIGHT LINES. 97 

118. The relation (3) of Art. 116 is equivalent to the 
expression 

&lt;x, h, g 

This may be easily verified by writing down the value 
of the determinant by the rule of Art. 5. 

A geometrical meaning to this form of the relation (3) 
will be given in a later chapter. 

The quantity on the left-hand side of equation (3) is 
called the Discriminant of the General Equation. 

The general equation therefore represents two straight 
lines if its discriminant be zero. 

119. Ex. 1. Prove that the equation 

12a;2 + Ixy - lOy"^ + 13a; + 45?/ - 35 = 
represents tioo straight lines, and find the angle between them. 
Here 

a=12, /i=|, &amp;=-10, g=^, /=-*/, and c=- 35. 
Hence abc + 2fgh - ap - bg^ - ch^ 

= 12 X ( - 10) X ( - 35) + 2 X ¥- x V- x ^ - 12 x (V)^ - ( - 10) x (V)^ 

-(-35)(i)2 
= 4200 + ^V- - 6075 + i^-^ + i J^5- 
= - 1875 + ^^-^^ = 0. 
The equation therefore represents two straight lines. 
Solving it for x, we have

angle between them, by Art. 66, 

Ex. 2. Find the value of h so that the equation 
6a;2 + 2hxy + 12y^ + 22a; + 31?/ + 20 = 
may represent two straight lines. 

Here 

a = 6, i = 12, ^ = 11, /=V-. andc = 20. 

The condition (3) of Art. 116 then gives 

20;i2- 341/1 +H*'-^=o, 
i.e. (/i -V^) (20/1- 171) = 0. 

Hence 7i= V- or ^. 

Taking the first of these values, the given equation becomes 
6^2 + nxy + 12y^ + 22x + 31?/ + 20 = 0, 
i.e. (2a; + 3?/ + 4) (3a; + 4?/ + 5) = 0. 

Taking the second value, the equation is 

20a;2 + 57a;?/ + 40?/2 + ^fa a; + H-2/ + -t- = 0, 
i.e. (4a; + o?/ + -V)(5a; + 8?/ + 10) = 0.

On division by x^, it may be written 

This is an equation of the nth degree in - , and hence

Let these roots be -m^, m^, mg, ... m„. Then (C. Smith's 
Algebra, Art. 89) the equation (1) must be equivalent to 
the equation

i.e. by all the points which lie on the n straight lines 

y — nijX = 0, y — m^x = 0, ... y — in^x = 0, 

all of which pass through the origin. Conversely, the 
coordinates of all the points which satisfy these n equa- 
tions satisfy equation (1). Hence the proposition. 

121. Ex. 1. The equation 

which is equivalent to 

{y-x){y-'lx){y-^x) = Q, 
represents the three straight lines 

y-x=.^, ?/-2a: = 0, and y-3a; = 0, 
all of which pass through the origin. 

Ex. 2. The equation y^ - 5y^ + 6y = 0, 
i.e. y{y-2){y-S) = 0, 

similarly represents the three straight lines 

y=0, y = 2, and y = S, 
all of which are parallel to the axis of x. 

122. To find the equation to the two straight lines 
joining the origin to the points in which the straight line 

Ix + my = n (1) 

meets the locus whose equation is 

ax^ + 2hxy + hy"^ + "Igx + 2fy + c = (2). 

The equation (1) may be written 
Ix + my 



n 



= 1 (3). 



The coordinates of the points in which the straight line 
meets the locus satisfy both equation (2) and equation (3), 
and hence satisfy the equation 

ax' + Vum) + by^ + 2 {gx +/y) '-^^ + c ('-^^)' = 

......(4). 

[For at the points where (3) and (4) are true it is clear 
that (2) is true.] 

Hence (4) represents so7ne locus which passes through 
the intersections of (2) and (3). 



STRAIGHT LINES THROUGH THE ORIGIN. 101 

But, since the equation (4) is homogeneous and of the 
second degree, it represents two straight lines passing 
through the origin (Art. 108). 

It therefore must represent the two straight lines join- 
ing the origin to the intersections of (2) and (3). 

123. The preceding article may be illustrated geo- 
metrically if we assume that the equation (2) represents 
some such curve as PQRS in the figure. 




■"'/O 



Let the given straight line cut the curve in the points 
P and Q. 

The equation (2) holds for all points on the curve PQRS. 
The equation (3) holds for all points on the line PQ. 
Both equations are therefore true at the points of 
intersection P and Q. 

The equation (4), which is derived from (2) and (3), 
holds therefore at P and Q. 

But the equation (4) represents two straight lines, each 
of which passes through the point 0. 

It must therefore represent the two straight lines OP 
and OQ. 

124. Ex. Prove that the straight lines joining the origin to the 
points of intersection of the straight line x-y=:2 and the curve 

5a;2 + 12a;i/ - 82/2 + 8a; - 4y + 12 = 

make equal angles with the axes. 

As in Art. 122 the equation to the required straight lines is 

5a;2 + 12a;?/-8i/2+(8a;-4i/)^^ + 12fc^Y = (1), 



102 • COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

For this equation is homogeneous and therefore represents two 
straight lines through the origin; also it is satisfied at the points 
where the two given equations are satisfied. 

Now (1) is, on reduction, 

so that the equations to the two lines are 

y = 2x and y= -2x. 
These lines are equally inclined to the axes. 

125. It was stated in Art. 115 that, in general^ an 
equation of the second degree represents a curve- line, 
including (Art. 116) as a particular case two straight lines. 

In some cases however it will be found that such 
equations only represent isolated points. Some examples 
are appended. 

EjX. 1. What is represented hy the locus 

{x-y + cf+{x + y-cY = 01 (1). 

We know that the sum of the squares of two real 
quantities cannot be zero unless each of the squares is 
separately zero. 

The only real points that satisfy the equation (1) 
therefore satisfy both of the equations 

cc — 2/ + c = and x + y—G = 0. 

But the only solution of these two equations is 

re = Oj and y = c. 

The only real point represented by equation (1) is therefore 
(0,c). 

The same result may be obtained in a different manner. 
The equation (1) gives 

{x-y-VGY^-(x + y-cf, 

i.e. x — y + c = ^ V— 1 {x + y — c). 

It therefore represents the two imaginary straight lines 

x{l- J'^) -y(l + J^) + c (1 + J^) = 0, 

and X (1 + J^l)-y (I - J^) + c(l - J~l) = 0. 



EQUATIONS REPRESENTING ISOLATED POINTS. 103 

Each of these two straight lines passes through the 
real point (0, c). We may therefore say that (1) represents 
two imaginary straight lines passing through the point 
(0, 0). 

£jX. 2. What is represented hy the equation 

As in the last example, the only real points on the locus 
are those that satisfy both of the equations 

oc^ — a^ — and y^ — h^ = 0, 

i.e. x = =i= a, and y = d=h. 

The points represented are therefore 

(a, h), {a, —h), (—a, b), and (—a, —6). 

Ex. 3. WTiat is represented by the equation 

The only real points on the locus are those that satisfy 
all three of the equations 

x = 0, 2/=0, and a = 0. 

Hence, unless a vanishes, there are no such points, and 
the given equation represents nothing real. 

The equation may be written 

a? + y^ = — a^y 

so that it represents points whose distance from the origin 

is asl—\. It therefore represents the imaginary circle 

whose radius is asJ—1 and whose centre is the origin. 

126. Es. 1. Obtain the condition that one of the straight lines 
given hy the equation 

ax^-\-2hxy + by^ = (1) 

may coincide with one of those given by the equation 

a'x^ + 2h'xy + bY=0 (2). 

Let the equation to the common straight line be 

y-m^x = (3). 

The quantity y -m^x must therefore be a factor of the left-hand of 
both (1) and (2), and therefore the value y = m^x must satisfy both (1) 
and (2). 



104 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

"We therefore have 

bmi^ + 2hm^ + a=:0 (4), 

and b'm^^ + 2h'm^ + a' = (5). 

Solving (4) and (5), we have

^ ha'-h'a _ ^_ f ab'-a'b ]^ 
■*• bh' -b'h~^~\2 {bh' - b'h)( ' 

so that we must have 

{ab' - a'&amp;)2 = 4 {ha' - h'a) {bh' - b'h) . 

Ex. 2. Prove that the equation 

m{x^-Sxy^) + y^-3x^y=0 

represents three straight lines equally inclined to one another. 

Transforming to polar coordinates (Art. 35) the equation gives 
m {GQS^d- 3 cos d sin2^) + sin3^ - 3 cos^^ sin ^ = 0, 
i.e. m(l-3tan2^) + tan3^-3tan^ = 0, 

3tan^-tan3^ ^ „^ 

If m=tan a, this equation gives 

tan 3^ = tan a, 
the solutions of which are 

3^ = a, or 180° + a, or 360° + a, 

i.e. ^ = |, or 60° + ^, or 120° + ^. 

The locus is therefore three straight lines through the origin 
inclined at angles 

^, 60° + |, and 120° + ^ 

to the axis of x. 

They are therefore equally inclined to one another. 

Ex. 3. Prove that two of the straight lines represented by the 
equation 

ax'^ + bx^y + cxy^ + dy^ = (1) 

will be at right angles if 

a^ + ac + hd + d^ = 0. 

Let the separate equations to the three lines be 

y-miX = 0, y-m2X=0, and y-m^x=0, 



EXAMPLES. 105 

so that the equation (1) must be equivalent to 

d{y - m-^x) (y - m^) (y - m^x) = 0, 

c 
and therefore mj^+m2+m^= -- (2), 

Wom3 + m3?7ij + 77ijm2 = -^ (3)i 

and m^m^m^ = - -^ (4). 

If the first two of these straight lines be at right angles we have, 
in addition, 

711^111.2= -1 (5). 

From (4) and (5), we have 

a 

and therefore, from (2), 

c a c + a 

The equation (3) then becomes 



a f c + a\ _b 



i.e. a^ + ac + bd + d^ = 0.

TRANSFORMATION OF COORDINATES. 



127. It is sometimes found desirable in the discussion 
of problems to alter the origin and axes of coordinates, 
either by altering the origin without alteration of the 
direction of the axes, or by altering the directions of the 
axes and keeping the origin unchanged, or by altering the 
origin and also the directions of the axes. The latter case 
is merely a combination of the first two. Either of these 
processes is called a transformation of coordinates. 

We proceed to establish the fundamental formulae for 
such transformation of coordinates. 

128. To alter the origin of coordinates without altering 
the directions of the axes. 

Let OX and Z be the original axes and let the new 
axes, parallel to the original, be 
O'X' and O'Y'. 

Let the coordinates of the new 
origin 0\ referred to the original 
axes be h and k, so that, if O'L be 
perpendicular to OX, we have 

OL = h and LO' = h. 

Let P be any point in the plane 
of the paper, and let its coordinates, referred to the original 
axes, be x and y, and referred to the new axes let them be 
x' and y'. 

Draw PN perpendicular to OX to meet OX' in N'. 



Y' 




p 

N' 







X'

COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



Then 

ON^x, NF = y, 0'N' = x, and N'F^y'. 

We therefore have 

X ^ 0N= OL + O'N' = h + x\ 

and y = FP = LO' + N'P = k + y'. 

The origin is therefore transferred to the point Qi, k) when 
we substitute for the coordinates x and y the quantities 

X + h and y' + k. 

The above article is true whether the axes be oblique 
or rectangular. 

129. To change the direction of the axes of coordinates, 
without changing the origin, both systems of coordinates being 
rectangular. 

Let OX and OF be the original system of axes and OX' 
and OY' the new system, and let 
the angle, XOX' , through which 
the axes are turned be called 0. Y' 

Take any point F in the plane 
of the paper. 

Draw FN and FN' perpen- 
dicular to OX and OX', and also 
N'L and N'M. perpendicular to OX and FN. 

If the coordinates of F, referred to the original axes, 
be X and y, and, referred to the new axes, be xi and y', we 
have 

ON^x, NF = y, ON'^x', and N'F = y. 

The angle 

MFN' - 90° - z MN'F^ l MN'O = z XOX' = 6. 

We then have 

X = 0N= OL -MN'= ON' cobO-N'F sine 

= x' cos — y sin (1), 

and y = NF = LN' + MF= ON' sin 6 + N'F cos $ 

= oj' sin ^ + 2/' cos ^ (2). 




CHANGE OF AXES. Ill 

If therefore in any equation we wish to turn the axes, 
being rectangular, through an angle we must substitute 

X' cos ^ — y' sin and x' sin ^ + y' cos 

for X and y. 

"When we have both to change the origin, and also the 
direction of the axes, the transformation is clearly obtained 
by combining the results of the previous articles. 

If the origin is to be transformed to the point (Ji, k) 
and the axes to be turned through an angle 6, we have to 
substitute 

h + X cos — y sin 6 and k + x sin + y cos 6 

for X and y respectively. 

The student, who is acquainted with the theory of projection of 
straight lines, will see that equations (1) and (2) express the fact that 
the projections of OP on OX and OY are respectively equal to the 
sum of the projections of ON' and N'P on the same two lines. 

130. Ex. 1. Transform to parallel axes through the 'point ( - 2, 3) 
the equation 

2a;2 + 4a;2/ + 5^/2 - 4^ - 22?/ + 7 =: 0. 

We substitute x=x' -2 and y=y' + S, and the equation becomes 

2 (x' - 2)3 + 4 (a;' - 2) (?/' + 3) + 5 (?/' + 3)2 - 4 (x' - 2) - 22 (i/' + 3) + 7 = 0, 

i.e. 2x'^ + 4xy + 5y'^-22 = 0. 

Ex. 2. Transform to axes inclined at 30° to the original axes the 
equation 

x'^ + 2fj3xy-y'^=2a^. 

For X and y we have to substitute 

flj' cos 30° - ?/ sin 30° and a;' sin 30° + ?/' cos 30°, 

t.e. — ^^r — - and ^--^— . 

The equation then becomes 

(a:V3 -2/T + 2 V3 (^V3 -2/') (^' + 2/V3) - (^' + 2/V3)'=8a2, 
i.e, x'^-y'^ = a^.

and (2) a^ + 2xy tan 2a- y^=aK 

6. If the axes be turned through an angle tan~i 2, what does the 
equation Axy - 3x^ = a^ become ? 

7. By transforming to parallel axes through a properly chosen 
point {h, k), prove that the equation 

12ciP-10xy + 2y^ + llx-5y + 2 = 0- 

can be reduced to one containing only terms of the second degree. 

8. Find the angle through which the axes may be turned so that 
the equation Ax + By + 0=0 

may be reduced to the form a; = constant, and determine the value of 
this constant. 

131. The general proposition, which is given in the 
next article, on the transformation from one set of oblique 
axes to any other set of oblique axes is of very little 
importance and is hardly ever required. 



CHANGE OF AXES. 113 

■*132. To change from one set of axes, inclined at an 
angle w, to another set, inclined at an angle w', the origin 
remaining unaltered.

Let OX and (9Fbe the original axes, OX' and OY' the 
new axes, and let the angle XOX' be 0. 

Take any point P in the plane of the paper. 
Draw PN and PN' parallel to 07 and OY' to meet OX 
and OX' respectively in N and iV", PL perpendicular to OX, 
and N'M and X'M' perpendicular to OL and LP. 
Now 

z PNL = L YOX = 0), and PN'M' = Y'OX = oi' + B. 
Hence if 

OX^x, NP^y, ON'^x, s.rvAN'P^y', 
we have y s&gt;\n.oi = NP ^irna^ LP = MX' + M'P 
= OX' sin + X'P sin (w' + 6), 

so that y sin w = cc' sin 6 + y' sin (w' + ^) (1). 

Also 

x-ryco&amp;oi^OX+XL=^OL=^OM-\-X'M' 

= x cosO + y'cos{oy' + e) (2). 

Multiplying (2) by sinw, (1) by cosw, and subtracting, 
we have 

X sin (o = x sin (w — ^) + y' sin (oi — w —6) (3). 

[This equation (3) may also be obtained by drawing a perpen- 
dicular from P upon OT and proceeding as for equation (1).] 

The equations (1) and (3) give the proper substitutions 
for the change of axes in the general case. 

As in Art. 130 the equations (1) and (2) may be obtained by 
equating the projections of OP and of ON' and N'P on OX and a 
straight line perpendicular to OX.

'^133. Particular' cases of the preceding article. 

(1) Suppose we wish to transfer our axes from a 
rectangular pair to one inclined at an angle w'. In this 
case (0 is 90°, and the formulse of the preceding article 
become 

x = x' cos 6 + y' cos (w' + 6), 
and y = ^' sin 6 + y sin (w' + 6). 

(2) Suppose the transference is to be from oblique 
axes, inclined at w, to rectangular axes. In this case co' is 
90°, and our formulse become 

X sin isi = X sin (w — ^) — y' cos (w — 0)^ 

and y sin o&gt; = a:;' sin 6 + y' cos ^. 

These particular formulse may easily be proved in- 
dependently, by drawing the corresponding figures. 



Ex. Transform the equation -2 - f^ = l from rectangular axes to 
axes inclined at an angle 2a, the new axis of x being inclined at an angle 
— a to the old axes and sin a being equal to — , . 

Here 6= -a and w' = 2a, so that the formulse of transformation 
(1) become 

a; = (a;' + y) cos a and y = [y' - x') sin a. 

Since sin a = , , we have cos a = , , and hence the 

x/a2+&amp;2 Ja'^ + b'^ 

given equation becomes 

i.e. x'y'=i{a'^ + b^). 

■*134. The degree of an equation is unchanged hy any 
transformation of coordinates. 

For the most general form of transformation is found 
by combining together Arts. 128 and 132, Hence the

CHANGE OF AXES. 115 

For X and y we have therefore to substitute expressions 
in X and y' of the first degree, so that by this substitution 
the degree of the equation cannot be raised. 

Neither can, by this substitution, the degree be lowered. 
For, if it could, then, by transforming back again, the 
degree would be raised and this we have just shewn to be 
impossible. 

*135. If by any change of axes, without change of origin, the 
quantity ax^ + Ihxy + &amp;i/^ become 

a'x'^ + 2h'xY + by% 

the axes in each case being rectangular, to prove that 

a + b = a' + b', and ab-h^ = a'b' -h'^. 

By Art. 129, the new axis of x being inclined at an angle 6 to the 
old axis, we have to substitute 

a;'cos^-2/'sin^ and x' sin + y' cos. 6 
for X and y respectively. 
Hence ax"^ + 2hxy + by'^ 
= a{x'cosd-y' sin ef + 2h {x' cose~y' sin d) {x' sin d + y' cos d) 

+ b{x'smd + y'cos6)^ 
= x'^ [a cos2 e + 2h cos Osind + b sin^ d] 

+ 2x'y' [-acosdsind + h (cos^ d - sin^i?) + &amp; cos ^ sin 9] 
+ y'^ \a sin2 d-2h cos ^ sin ^ + &amp; cos^ d]. 
We then have 

tt' = a cos^ ^ + 2/i cos ^ sin ^ + 6 sin^ (9 

= 1 [(a + &amp;) + (« -6) cos 2^ + 2/1 sin 2^] (1), 

b' = aBin^d- 2h cos ^ sin ^ + 6 cos^^ 

= i[(a + 6)-(a-&amp;)cos2^-27isin2^] (2), 

and /i'= -acos^sin^ + /i(cos2^-sin2^) + &amp;cos^sin^ 

= i[2;icos2^-(a-&amp;)sin2^j (3). 

By adding ( 1) and (2) , we have «' + &amp;'=« + &amp;. 
Also, by multiplying them, we have 

4a'&amp;' = (a + 6)2 - { (a - h) cos 2d +-2h sin 26}^. 
Hence 4a'&amp;' - 47i'2 
= (a + 6)2 _ i{2h sin 2d + {a- b) cos 20]^+ {2h cos 20 -{a- b) sin 20}^ 
= (a + &amp;)2 _ [(a - 6)2 + 4/i2] = 4a6 - 4h% 
so that a'b'-h'^ = ab-h^. 

136. To find the angle through which the axes must be turned so 
that the expression ax^ + 2hxy + by^ may become an expression in which 
there is no term involving x'y'.

*137. The proposition of Art. 135 is a particular 
case, when the axes are rectangular, of the folloM^ing more 
general proposition. 

If hy any change of axes, without change of origin, the 
quantity ax- + ^hxy + 6?/" becomes a'x'^ + 2h'xy + 6'^/^, then

of axes. 

Let the coordinates of any point P, referred to the 
original axes, be x and y and, referred to the final axes, let 
them be x and y . 

By Art. 20 the square of the distance between P and 
the origin is o^ + 2xy cos a&gt; + 2/^, referred to the original axes, 
and x'^ + 2xy cos w' + y"^^ referred to the final axes. 

We therefore always have 

X- + Ixy cos w + 2/^ = a;'^ + ^xy cos m -vy''^ (1). 

Also, by supposition, we have 

ax"" + 2hxy + by"" = ax'- + 2h'xy' + b'lj^ (2). 

Multiplying (1) by \ and adding it to (2), we therefore have 
x^ (« + X) + 2xy (h + X cos to) +y^ (b + X) 

= x"" (a' + X) + 2x'y' {h' + X cos o&gt;') + y" {b' + X) . . .(3). 
If then any value of X makes the left-hand side of (3) a 
perfect square, the same value must make the right-hand 
side also a perfect square. 

But the values of X which make the left-hand a perfect 
square are given by the condition 

(h + X cos (o)2 -(a + X) {b + X), 



EXAMPLES. 117 

i.e. by 

\2 (1 - cos^ w) + X{a + h-2h cos oi) + ab- h^ = 0, 

^„ . a + h — 2hcos(ji ab — h^^ ,,, 

i.e. by X^ + X r^ + -r-^ — = (4). 

In a similar manner the values of A, which make the 

right-hand side of (3) a perfect square are given by the 

equation 

^a' + b'-2h'cosoy' a'b'-h'^ ^

Since the values of \ given by equation (4) are the same

CHAPTER VIII. 



THE CIRCLE. 



138. Def. A circle is the locus of a point which 
moves so that its distance from a fixed point, called the 
centre, is equal to a given distance, 
called the radius of the circle. 



The given distance is 



139. To find the equation to a circle, the axes of coordi- 
nates being two straight lines through its centre at right 
angles. 

Let be the centre of the circle and let a be its radius. 

Let OX and OF be the axes of 
coordinates. 

Let P be any point on the circum- 
ference of the circle, and let its coordi- 
nates be X and y. 

Draw PJf perpendicular to OX and 
join OP. 

Then (Euc. I. 47) 

OM^ + MP' = a', 

i.e. x2 + y2 = a2. 

This being the relation which holds between the coordi- 
nates of any point on the circumference is, by Art. 42, the 
required equation. 

140. To find the equation to a circle referred to any 
rectangular axes. 




THE CIRCLE. 



119 




Let OX and (9 F be the two rectangular axes. 

Let C be the centre of the 
circle and a its radius. 

Take any point P on the 
circumference and draw per- 
pendiculars CM and FN upon 
OX ; let F be the point (x, y). 

Draw GL perpendicular to 
NF. 

Let the coordinates of G be 
h and h ; these are supposed to be known. 

We have GL = MN= ON- OM=x- h, 
and LF = NF-NL = NF-MG^y-h. 

Hence, since GL^ + LF^ = GF\ 
we have (x-h)2+ (y-k)2 = a2 (1). 

This is the required equation. 

Ex. The equation to the circle, whose centre is the point ( - 3, 4) 
and whose radius is 7, is 

i.e. a;2 + 2/2 + 6a:-8?/ = 24. 

141. Some particular cases of the preceding article may be 
noticed : 

(a) Let the origin be on the circle so that, in this case, 

i.e. h^ + Jc'^=a^. 

The equation (1) then becomes 

i.e. x'^ + y^-2hx-2ky = 0. 

(jS) Let the origin be not on the curve, but let the centre lie on 
the axis of x. In this case k = 0, and the equation becomes 

{x - lif ■\-y^ = a^. 

(7) Let the origin be on the curve and let the axis of re be a 
diameter. We now have fe = and a = h, so that the equation becomes 

x^ + t/-2hx = 0. 

(8) By taking at C, and thus making both h and k Tiero, we 
have the case of Art. 139. 



120 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

(e) The circle will touch the axis of x if MG be equal to the 
radius, i.e. if k = a. 

The equation to a circle touching the axis of x is therefore 

x'^ + 7f-2hx-2ky + h'^ = Q. 
Similarly, one touching the axis of y is 

x^ + y^-2hx-2ky + k^ = 0. 

142. To prove that the equation 

a^ + 2/'+2^a;+2/2/ + c = (1), 

always represents a circle for all values of g,f and c, and to 
find its centre and radius. [The axes are assumed to be 
rectangular.] 

This equation may be written 

{a? + 2gx + cf) + {f + 2/2/ +/^) = cf +f' - c, 

i.e. {X + gf 4- {y +ff = {JfTp^cf. 

Comparing this with the equation (1) of Art. 140, we 
see that the equations are the same if 

h = -g, h^-f and a = Jg"" -hf^-c. 

Hence (1) represents a circle whose centre is the point 
(— ^, —f), and whose radius is Jg^-^f^ — c. 

If g^ +f' &gt; c, the radius of this circle is real. 

If g^ +f'^ = c, the radius vanishes, i. e. the circle becomes 
a point coinciding with the point (— ^, —f). Such a circle 
is called a point-circle. 

If g^ +f^ &lt; c, the radius of the circle is imaginary. In 
this case the equation does not represent any real geo- 
metrical locus. It is better not to say that the circle does 
not exist, but to say that it is a circle with a real centre 
and an imaginary radius. 

Ex. 1. The equation x"^ + ij^ + 4^x - 6y = can be written in the 
form 

{x + 2f + iy-Bf = lS = {JlS)\ 

and therefore represents a circle whose centre is the point ( - 2, 3) and 
whose radius is &gt;,yi3. 



GENERAL EQUATION TO A CIRCLE. 121 

Ex. 2. The equation 45a;2 + 45?/2 - 60x- + SQy + 19 = is equivalent 
to 

i.e. («'-|)^ + (y + F=f + ^*5-H=/A, 

and therefore represents a circle whose centre is the point (f , -|) and 

whose radius is —=- . 
15 

143. Condition that the general equation of the second 
degree may represent a circle. 

The equation (1) of the preceding article, multiplied by 
any arbitrary constant, is a particular case of the general 
equation of the second degree (Art. 114) in which there is 
no term containing xy and in which the coefficients of x^ 
and y^ are equal. 

The general equation of the second degree in rectangular 
coordinates therefore represents a circle if the coefficients 
of x^ and y^ be the same and if the coefficient of xy 
be zero. 

144. The equation (1) of Art. 142 is called the 
general equation of a circle^ since it can, by a proper 
choice of g, f and c, be made to represent any circle. 

The three constants g, f, and c in the general equation 
correspond to the geometrical fact that a circle can be found 
to satisfy three independent geometrical conditions and no 
more. Thus a circle is determined when three points on it 
are given, or when it is required to touch three straight 
lines. 

145. To find the equation to the circle which is described on the 
line joining the points {x-^ , y-^) and (x^ , 2/2) ^^ diameter. 

Let A be the point (a;^, y-^) and B be the point {x^, 2/2) » ^^^ ^^^ ^^^ 
coordinates of any point P on the circle be h and k. 

The equation to AP is (Art. 62) 

y-yi=j^i^-^i) (1). 

and the equation to BP is 

2/ -2/2=^' (^-^2) (2). 

But, since APB is a semicircle, the angle APB is a right angle, 
and hence the straight Unes (1) and (2) are at right angles. 



122 



COOKDINATE GEOMETRY. 



Hence, by Art. 69, we have 

^-Vi _ h^ljh^ _ 1 

i.e. (h-x-^){h-x^) + {k-yj}{Jc-y2) = 0. 

But this is the condition that the point {h, k) may lie on the curve 
whose equation is 

{X - x^) {x - x^) + {y- y^) {y - y^) = 0. 
This therefore is the required equation. 

146. Intercepts made on the axes by the circle whose equation is 

ax^ + ay^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = (1). 

The abscissae of the points where the circle (1) meets the axis of x, 
i.e. y = 0, are given by the equation 

ax^ + 2gx + c = (2). 

The roots of this equation being Xj^ and x^ , 
we have 



^ + •^2

and 






(Art. 2. 




Hence 



A-^A^ = x^ -x-^= J{x-^-\-x^^ - 4x-^i 



V a2 



= 2 



a a 

Again, the roots of the equation (2) are both imaginary if g^&lt;ac. 
In this case the circle does not meet the axis of x in real points, i.e. 
geometrically it does not meet the axis of x at all. 

The circle will touch the axis of x if the intercept A-^A^, be just 
zero, i.e. ii g^ = ac. 

It will meet the axis of x in two points lying on opposite sides of 
the origin if the two roots of the equation (2) are of opposite signs, 
i. e. if c be negative. 

147. Ex.1. Find the equation to the circle which passes through 
the points (1, 0), (0, - 6), and (3, 4). 

Let the equation to the circle be 

x^ + y^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = (1). 

Since the three points, whose coordinates are given, satisfy this 
equation, we have 

l + 2^ + c = (2), 

36-12/+c=0 (3), 

and 25 + 6^ + 8/+c = (4). 



EXAMPLES. 123 

Subtracting (2) from (3) and (3) from (4), we have 

2^ + 12/= 35, 
and 65f + 20/=ll. 

Hence /=*/- and g=z -iJ-. 

Equation (2) then gives c = ^-. 
Substituting these values in (1) the required equation is 
4a;2 + 4i/2 - 142a; + 47a; + 138 = 0. 

Ex. 2. Find the equation to the circle which touches the axis ofy 
at a distance + 4 from the origin and cuts off an intercept 6 from the 
axis of X. 

Any circle is x^ + y'^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. 

This meets the axis of y in points given by 

y^ + 2fy + c = 0. 

The roots of this equation must be equal and each equal to 4, so 
that it must be equivalent to {y - 4)^ = 0. 

Hence 2/= -8, and c = 16. 

The equation to the circle is then 

x'^ + y^ + 2gx-8y + 16 = 0. 
This meets the axis of x in points given by 
x'^ + 2gx + l&amp;:=0, 
i.e. at points distant 

-g+slT^^ and -g-Jg^lJG, 
Hence Q = 2^g^-ie. 

Therefore ^= ±5, and the required equation is 

x^ + y^±10x-8y + U = 0. 
There are therefore two circles satisfying the given conditions. 
This is geometrically obvious.

From this property may be deduced the equation to the 
tangent at any point (x\ y') of the circle x^ ^-y^ — o?. 

For let the point P (Fig. Art. 139) be the point 
(a;', y'). 

The equation to any straight line passing through T is, 
by Art. 62, 

y~ y' = m, {x — x) (1). 

Also the equation to OP is 

3/ = |* (2). 



126 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The straight lines (1) and (2) are at right angles, i.e. the 
line (1) is a tangent, if 

mx^ = -l, (Art. 69) 

I. e. II m = &gt; . 

y 

Substituting this value of m in (1), the equation of the 
tangent at {x\ y) is 

y-y =--f{^-^h 

t.e. xx+yy— x'^ + y (oj. 

But, since {x, y) lies on the circle, we have x^ + y"^ — a^, 
and the required equation is then 

XX' + yy' = a2. 

149. In the case of most curves it is impossible to 
give a simple construction for the tangent as in the case of 
the circle. It is therefore necessary, in general, to give a 
different definition. 

Tangent. Def. Let F and Q be any two points, near 
to one another, on any curve. 

Join TQ \ then FQ is called a 
secant. 

The position of the line PQ when 
the point Q is taken indefinitely close 
to, and ultimately coincident with, the 
point F is called the tangent at F. X ^ 

The student may better appreciate ^^--,___^^ 

this definition, if he conceive the curve 

to be made up of a succession of very small points (much 
smaller than could be made by the finest conceivable drawing 
pen) packed close to one another along the curve. The 
tangent at F is then the straight line joining F and the 
next of these small points. 

150. To find the equation of the tangent at the imint 
{x\ y) of the circle x^ + y^ = a^. 



EQUATION TO THE TANGENT. 127 

Let P be the given point and Q a point (x\ y") lying on 
the curve and close to P. 

The equation to FQ is then 

y-2/' = f^(»-»^') (1)- 

Since both (cc', y) and {x\ y") lie on the circle, we have 

x'^ + y'^ = a\ 

and x"^ + y'"^ = a^. 

By subtraction, we have 

x"^-x" + y"'-y" = 0, 
i. e. {x" - x') {x" + x') + (y" - y') (y" + y') ^ 0, 

// / It , r 

y —y X + x 
X - X y + y 
Substituting this value in (1), the equation to FQ is 

y-y'=-^^'(''-'') (^)- 

Now let Q be taken very close to F, so that it ulti- 
mately coincides with P, i, e. put x" = x and y" = y. 
Then (2) becomes 

2x 

y-y' = -7y-A^-^\ 
^y 

i. e. yy' + xx' — x'^ + y'^ = a^. 

The required equation is therefore 

xx' + yy' = a2 (3). 

It will be noted that the equation to the tangent 
found in this article coincides with the equation found 
from Euclid's definition in Art. 148. 

Our definition of a tangent and Euclid's definition there- 
fore give the same straight line in the case of a circle, 

151. To obtain the equation of the tangent at any point 
(x'y y') lying on the circle 

x^ + y'^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. 



128 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Let P be the given point and Q a point (x'\ y") lying on 
the curve close to P. 

The equation to PQ is therefore 

2/-2/' = C^!(«-x') (1). 

Since both (x\ y) and (cc", y") lie on the circle, we have 

x'^ + y'^ + 'lgx' + 2fy' + C = (2), 

and x"^ + y"' + 2gx" + 2fy" + c^^ (3). 

By subtraction, we have 

^- _ x'^ + y"^ _ y- + 2g (x" - x') + 2/(y" - y') = 0, 
i. e. (x" - x) {x" + x' + 2g) + (y" - y') {y" + y' + 2/) = 0, 
y —y X + X •{• Zg 
X - X y +y +2/ 

Substituting this value in (1), the equation to PQ be- 
comes 

f X + X + Ag . ,. / , V 

Now let Q be taken very close to P, so that it ultimately 
coincides with P, i. e. put x" — x and y" = y'. 

The equation (4) then becomes 
^. e. y {y +/) + 0^(03' + ^) = y' {y' +f)+x {x' + g) 

to fO / /• / 

= a:^ + 2/- + p'aj +fy 

= -9^' -fy -(^i 
by (2). 

This may be written 

XX' + yy' + g (x + X') + f (y + y) + c = O 

which is the required equation. 

152. The equation to the tangent at (x', y') is there- 
fore obtained from that of the circle itself by substituting 
XX for x^y yy' for y^, x ■{■ x' for 2a;, and y -V y for 2y. 



INTERSECTIONS OF A STRAIGHT LINE AND A CIRCLE. 129 

This is a particular case of a general rule Avhich will be 
found to enable us to write down at sight the equation to 
the tangent at ix\ y') to any of the curves with which we 
shall deal in this book. 

153. Points of intersection, in general, of the straight 
line 

y^mx -\- G (1), 

with the circle x' + y^ = d^ (2). 




The coordinates of the points in which the straight line 
(1) meets (2) satisfy both equations (1) and (2). 

If therefore we solve them as simultaneous equations 
we shall obtain the coordinates of the common point or 
points. 

Substituting for y from (1) in (2), the abscissae of the 
required points are given by the equation 

x^ + {mx + c)^ = a^, 

i.e. x^ (1 + m^) + 2mcx + c^ — «- = (3). 

The roots of this equation are, by Art. 1, real, coinci- 
dent, or imaginary, according as 

(2mc)^ — 4 (1 + m^) (c^ — a^) is positive, zero, or negative, 

i.e. according as 

a? {\ -\- m^) — c^ is positive, zero, or negative, 

i.e. according as 

c^ is &lt; = or &gt; a^ (1 + m^). 

In the figure the lines marked I, II, and III are all 
parallel, i.e. their equations all have the same "r/i." 

L. 9 



130 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The straight line I corresponds to a value of c^ which 
is &lt;a^ (1 + oYv^) and it meets the circle in two real points. 

The straight line III which corresponds to a value of c^, 
&gt; a^ (1 + m^), does not meet the circle at all, or rather, as in 
Art. 108, this is better expressed by saying that it meets 
the circle in imaginary points. 

The straight line II corresponds to a value of c', which 
is equal to a^ (1 + m^), and meets the curve in two coincident 
points, i.e. is a tangent. 

154. We can now obtain the length of the chord inter- 
cepted by the circle on the straight line (1). For, if x^ and 
X2 be the roots of the equation (3), we have 

2mc _, c^ — cC- 

^ ^ 1 + m" ^ ^ 1 + m^ 

Hence

If 2/1 and 2/2 ^^ t^6 ordinates of Q and R we have, since 
these points are on (1), 

2/1 — 2/2 = {mx-^ + &lt;^) "~ (^^2 + c) = rri {x^ — x^. 
Hence 

QR = J(yi - y^Y + K - oc^y = Jl+ m' (x^^ - x.^

a^ (1 + m^) — c^

In a similar manner we can consider the points of inter- 
section of the straight line y = mx + k with the circle 

a;^ + 2/2 + 2yx + 2fy + c = 0. 

155. The straight line 

y = mx + ajl + m^ 
is always a. tangent to the circle 

2 Q o 

X + y — a . 



EQUATION TO ANY TANGENT. 131 

As in Art. 153 the straight line 
y = mx + G 
meets the circle in two points which are coincident if 

But if a straight line meets the circle in two points 
which are indefinitely close to one another then, by Art. 
149, it is a tangent to the circle. 

The straight line y = mx + c is therefore a tangent to the 
circle if 

G^a J\ + 772^, 

i.e. the equation to any tangent to the circle is 

y = mx + a Vl + m2 (1). 

Since the radical on the right hand may have the + or — 
sign prefixed we see that corresponding to any value of in 
there are two tangents. They are marked II and IV in 
the figure of Art. 153. 

156. The above result may also be deduced from the equation 
(3) of Art. 150, which may be written 

x' a2 
y= --«+- (1). 

y y 

x' 
Put — , = 'm, so that x'= -my' , and the relation .r'- + ?/'2 = a^ gives 

y'^{m^+l) = a^, i.e. —= /Jl+m^. 
The equation (1) then becomes 

y = mx + afjl + m\ 
This is therefore the tangent at the point whose coordinates are 

~ma . a 

and 



Vi + w2 7i +

157. If we assume that a tangent to a circle is always perpen- 
dicular to the radius vector to the point of contact, the result of 
Art. 155 may be obtained in another manner. 

For a tangent is a line whose perpendicular distance from the 
centre is equal to the radius. 

9—2 



132 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The straight line y=mx + c will therefore touch the circle if the 
perpendicular on it from the origin be equal to a, i.e. if 



i.e. if c = a /sjl + m^. 

This method is not however applicable to any other curve besides the 
circle. 

158. Ex. Find the equations to the tangents to the circle 

x'^ + y^-6x + Ay = 12 

which are parallel to the straight line 

4a;+3i/ + 5 = 0. 

Any straight line parallel to the given one is ' 

4a: + 32/ + (7 = (1). 

The equation to the circle is 

(a; -3)2 + (2/ + 2)2 =52. 

The straight line (1), if it be a tangent, must be therefore such 
that its distance from the point (3, - 2) is equal to ±5. 

Hence ^l7^±f=:±5 (Art. 75), 

V4H32 

so that (7= -6=t25 = 19or -31. 

The required tangents are therefore 

4a; + 32/ + 19 = and 4;r + 3?/-31 = 0. 

159. Normal. Def. The normal at any point P of 
a curve is the straight line which passes through P and is 
perpendicular to the tangent at P. 

To find the equation to the normal at the j^oint (x', y'^ of 
(1) the circle 

X- + 2/ = a% 
and (2) the circle 

X- + y^ + Igx + 2/2/ + c = 0. 

(1) The tangent at (.t', 3/') is 

XX + yy — a^, 

X a^ 
i.e. y^ ,x + — . 

y y 



THE NORMAL TO THE CIRCLE. 133 

The equation to the straight line passing through {x\ y) 
perpendicular to this tangent is 

y-y' ^m{x- x), 
where m x (- %] = - 1, (Art. 69), 

y' 

X 

The required equation is therefore 

y-y ^-'(^-^-^)' . 

i. e. X y — xy = 0. 

This straight line passes through the centre of the circle 
which is the point (0, 0). 

If we assume Euclid's propositions the equation is at once 
written down, since the normal is the straight line joining 
(0, 0) to («;', 2/'). 

(2) The equation to the tangent at {x ^ y) to the circle 

'£ + i/-^ + ^yx + %fy + c — 

X + CI gx + fu + c , ^ T ^ ^ V 

IS y = -- — -.x-^- /-^^ . (Art. 151.) 

The equation to the straight line, passing through the 
point (a;', ?/') and perpendicular to this tangent, is 

y-y =m{x- x'), 
where m x f-%^\ - - 1, (Art. 69), 

y+f 

I.e. m^—, — - . 

x + g 

The equation to the normal is therefore 

y-y'-^K~^{^-x), 

X + g ^ ' 

i. e. y {x' +g)-x{y +/)+ fx - gy' = 0.

Let the equation to the circle be '3t? ■\- y"^ — «', and let the 
given point be (ajj, y^. [Fig. Art. 161.] 

The equation to any tangent is, by Art. 155, 
y — mx + a J\ + rn?. 



136 COORDINATE GEOMETllY. 

If this pass through the given point (xj^, y^ we have 
v/i = mx'i + aj\ + m^ (1). 

This is the equation which gives the values of m corre- 
sponding to the tangents which pass through (x-^^^ y^). 

Now (1) gives 

?/i — jiid\ — a Jl + m^, 

i.e. y^ — 2rax-^y-^ + m^x^ = «- + ahn^^ 

i. e. m^ {xj^ — a^) — 2mx^y^ + y-^^ — a^ = (2). 

The equation (2) is a quadratic equation and gives 
therefore two values of ?m (real, coincident, or imaginary) 
corresponding to any given values of x^^ and y^. For each 
of these values of 7?i we have a corresponding tangent. 

The roots of (2) are, by Art. 1, real, coincident or 
imaginary according as 

(2xi?/i)^ — 4 (.r/ — a"^) (2/1^ — a^) is positive, zero, or negative, 

i. e. according as 

a^ (— a"^ + Xj^ + y^) is positive, zero, or negative, 

i. e. according as x-^ + y^ =■- a?. 

If x^ + y^&gt; a^, the distance of the point (x^^, y^) from 
the centre is greater than the radius and hence it lies outside 
the circle. 

If x{- + yi = a?, the point {x^ , y^ lies on the circle and 
the two coincident tangents become the tangent at (x-^^ , y^. 

If x-^ + y^ &lt;«^, the point {x-^^ y^ lies within the circle, 
and no tangents can then be geometrically drawn to the 
circle. It is however better to say that the tangents are 
imaginary. 

161. Chord of Contact. Def. If from any point 
T without a circle two tangents TP and TQ be drawn to 
the circle, the straight line PQ joining the points of 
contact is called the chord of contact of tangents from T. 

To find the equation of the chord of contact of tangents 
drawn to the circle x^ + y"^ — a^ from the external point 
(^1, 2/i)- 



POLE AND POLAR. 



137 







•(3), 
.(4). 



Let T be the point (x^, y^), and F and ^ the points 
(oj'j 2/') and (a?", y") respectively. 

The tangent at F is 

XX +1/1/' — a-^ (1), 

and that at Q is 

xx" + yy" —d^ (2). 

Since these tangents pass through 
T^ its coordinates {x-^ , y^ must satisfy 
both (1) and (2). 

Hence x-^ + y^y — a? 

and x^od' + y-^y" = cir 

The equation to FQ is then 

xxi + yyi=a2 (5). 

For, since (3) is true, it follows that the point {x ^ y), 
i.e. F, lies on (5). 

Also, since (4) is true, it follows that the point (x\ y")^ 
i.e. Q, lies on (5). 

Hence both F and Q lie on the straight line (5), i.e. 
(5) is the equation to the required chord of contact. 

If the point {x^, y^) lie within the circle the argument 
of the preceding article will shew that the line joining the 
(imaginary) points of contact of the two (imaginary) 
tangents drawn from (x^ , y^) is xx^ + yy^ — a^. 

We thus see, since this line is always real, that we may 
have a real straight line joining the imaginary points of 
contact of two imaginary tangents. 



162. Pole and Polar. Def. If through a point 
F (within or without a circle) there be drawn any straight 
line to meet the circle in Q and F, the locus of the point of 
intersection of the tangents at Q and F is called the polar 
of F ; also F is called the pole of the polar. 

In the next article the locus will be proved to be a 
straight line. 



138 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



163. To Jincl the equation to the 'polar of the point 
(^ij 2/1) '^^ih respect to the circle x^ ■\-y^ — d^. 





Let QR be any chord drawn through P and let the 
tangents at Q and R meet in the point :Z^ whose coordinates 
are (A, k). 

Hence QR is the chord of contact of tangents drawn 
from the point (h, k) and therefore, by Art. 161, its 
equation is xh ■\- yk — o?. 

Since this line passes through the point (x-^, y^ we 
have 

x-Ji + y^ — a" (1). 

Since the relation (1) is true it follows that the 
variable point (A, k) always lies on the straight line whose 
equation is 

xxi + yyi = a2 (2). 

Hence (2) is the polar of the point (x^, y^). 

In a similar manner it may be proved that the polar of 
(x'l, i/i) with respect to the circle 

o(^ + y^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = 

is xx^ -^yvi + g (x + xi) +/ (y + yi) + c=^ 0. 

164. The equation (2) of the preceding article is the 
same as equation (5) of Art. 161. If, therefore, the point 
{xi, 2/i) be without the circle, as in the right-hand figure, 
the polar is the same as the chord of contact of the real 
tangents drawn through (x^^, y^). 

If the point (x^, y^) be on the circle, the polar coincides 
with the tangent at it. (Art. 150.) 



GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTION FOR THE POLAR. 139 

If the point (x^, y-f) be within the circle, then, as in 
Art. 161, the equation (2) is the line joining the (imaginary) 
points of contact of the two (imaginary) tangents that can 
be drawn from (x-^ , y^. 

We see therefore that the polar might have been 
defined as follows : 

The polar of a given point is the straight line which 
passes through the (real or imaginary) points of contact of 
tangents drawn from the given point ; also the pole of any 
straight line is the point of intersection of tangents at the 
points (real or imaginary) in which this straight line meets 
the circle. 



165. Geometrical construction for the imlar of a point.

Also the polar of P is

By Art. 69, the lines (1) and (2) are perpendicular to

of P. 

Also the length OP - ^x^+y}, 



140 COORDINATE GEOMETRY, 

and the perpendicular, OiV, from upon (2) 

Hence the product ON . OP — a^. 

The polar of any point P is therefore constructed thus : 
Join OP and on it (produced if necessary) take a point N 
such that the rectangle ON . OP is equal to the square of 
the radius of the circle. 

Through N draw the straight line LL' perpendicular to 
OP ; this is the polar required. 

[It will be noted that the middle point N of any chord LL' lies on 
the line joining the centre to the pole of the chord.] 

166. To Jind the pole of a given line with respect to 
any circle. 

Let the equation to the given line be 

^a; + % + (7-0 (1). 

(1) Let the equation to the circle be 

and let the required pole be {x-^, y-^. 

Then (1) must be the equation to the polar of (oji, y^, 
i.e. it is the same as the equation 

xx-^ + yVi — cv^-O (2). 

Comparing equations (1) and (2), Ave have 

J B C ' 

so that Xt — — yz a^ and y, = — '^ a?. 

C ^ C 

The required pole is therefore the point 

A , B ^ 

(2) Let the equation to the circle be 
a;- + 2/2 + l.yx + 2fy + g=Q. 



POLE AND POLAR. 141 

If (a?!, 2/1) ^^ *^® required pole, then (1) must be 
equivalent to the equation 

xx^ +yyi + g{os + x,) +f{y + yi) + c=0, (Art. 1 63), 

i.e. x(x^+g)+y{y^+f) + gxj^ +/2/i + c = (3). 

Comparing (1) with (3), we therefore have 

- sc^ + 9 _ Vi+f^ 9^1 +/2/1 + g 
A " B C 

By solving these equations we have the values of x^ 
and 2/1. 

Ex. Find the pole of the straight line 

9x+2j-28 = (1) 

2vith respect to the circle 

2x^+2y'^-Sx + 5ij-7 = (2). 

If (.Tj, yj) be the required point the line (1) must coincide with the 
polar of (x^, 2/i)' whose equation is 

2xx^ + 2yy-^-i{x + x^)+^{y+y{j-l = 0, 

i.e. x{4x^-d) + y{4:y^ + 5)-3xi + 5y^-U = (3). 

Since (1) and (3) are the same, we have 

4.'Ci - 3 _ 4|/i + 5 _ -Sxi + 5y^ - 14 

9 r~ ~ ^28 ■ 

Hence Xi = 9yi + 12, 

and 3.Ti-117i/i = 126. 

Solving these equations we have Xj^ = S and t/^ = - 1, so that the 
required point is (3, - 1). 

167. If the 2')olar of a point P pass through a point T, 
then the polar of T passes through P. 

Let P and T be the points {x-^, y^ and (.Tg, 2/2) ^^-

142 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Since the relation (1) is true it follows that the point 
(x^, 2/1), i.e. P, lies on the straight line xx^-\-yy^ = (]?^ which 
is the polar of {x^^ y^)^ i.e. T, with respect to the circle. 

Hence the proposition. 

Cor. The intersection, T, of the polars of two points, 
P and Q, is the pole of the line PQ. 

168. To find the length of the tangent that can he 
drawn from the point (x^ , y-^ to the circles 

(1) a?-^y'^ = a\ 

and (2) x? + y^ + 2gx + 2/^/ + c = 0. 

If T be an external point (Fig. Art. 163), TQ a tangent 
and the centre of the circle, then TQO is a right angle 
and hence 

(1) If the equation to the circle be x" ^-y"- — a^, is the 
origin, OT'^ = x^- + y^.^ and OQ^ = a^. 

Hence TQ" = x^^ + y^- - a\ 

(2) Let the equation to the circle be 

x^ + y'^+ 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, 
i.e. (x + gf-v{y+fY = f+f'-c. 

In this case is the point (— g, —f) and 

OQ^ — (radius)^ = g'^ +f^ — c. 
Hence OT^ = [x, - (- g)Y + [y, - (-/)]' (Art. 20). 

Therefore TQ^ ^ {x, + gf + (y, +ff - (f +p - c) 

= &lt;^ + Vi+'^g^i + 2/J/i + c. 

In each case we see that (the equation to the circle 
being written so that the coefficients of x^ and y" are each 
unity) the square of the length of the tangent drawn to the 
circle from the point {x^, y^) is obtained by substituting x^ 
and 2/1 for the current coordinates in the left-hand member 
of the equation to the circle. 

*169. To find the equation to the pair of tangents that 
can he drawn from the point (x-^^ y^) to the circle x- + y^ — d^. 



PAIR OF TANGENTS FROM ANY POINT. 143 

Let (A, k) be any point on either of the tangents from 

(^1, Vi)' 

Since any straight line touches a circle if the perpen- 
dicular on it from the centre is equal to the radius, the 
perpendicular from the origin upon the line joining (x^, y^) 
to (A, k) must be equal to a. 

The equation to the straight line joining these two 
points is 

^ — Vi / 

i.e. yQ^~~ ^'i) ~ ^ (^ ~ 2/1) + ^^1 ~~ ^^Ui — ^■ 

__ kx^ — hy^ 

Hence , ^ = a, 

J(h-x,f+(k-y,y 

so that (kx^ — hy^y = a^ [{h — oo^y + {k — 2/1)^]- 

Therefore the point (h, k) always lies on the locus 

{x^y - xy^f = a" [{x - x^y + {y- y,y] (1). 

This therefore is the required equation. 

The equation (1) may be written in the form 

= 2xyx^yi — 2a^xXj^ — 2a^yyi, 
i.e. (x^ + y'^- CL^) {^i + y\ — «^) = x'^X{' + y^y^ + a^ + 2xyx{y^ 
— 2a^xXi — 2c^yy-^ — {xx^ + yy^ — a^y (2). 

#170. In a later chapter we shall obtain the equation to the pair 
of tangents to any curve of the second degree in a form analogous 
to that of equation (2) of the previous article. 

Similarly the equation to the pair of tangents that can be 
drawn from {x-^, y-^ to the circle 

If the equation to the circle be given in the form 
a;2 + 2/2 + 2,9ra; + 2/?/ + c = 
the equation to the tangents is, similarly, 

{x' + ^2 + ^g^ + 2/y + c) {x^ + y^ + 2^a;i + 2jy^ + c) 

= \xx^^yy^^g{x\x^^f{y^ry^) + cf (2).

Then {Trig. Art. 164) we have 

CP- ^ OC'^ -r OP' -20C. OP cos C OF, 
i.e. a''^P^ + r'-2Prcos(e~a), 
i.e. r'- -2Rr cos {0 - a) + R"" - a" ^0 (1). 

This is the required polar equation. 

172. Particular cases of the general equation inpolar coordinates. 

(1) Let the initial line be taken to go through the centre G. Then 
a = 0, and the equation becomes 

r2 - 2Rr cos ^ + E^ - a^ = 0. 

(2) Let the pole be taken on the circle, so that 

B=OG = a. 
The general equation then becomes 
^^M r^-2arcos{d-a) = 0, 

i.e. r=2acos{d - a). 

(3) Let the pole be on the circle and also let the initial line pass 
through the centre of the circle. In this case 

a=0, and R — a. 

The general equation reduces then to the 
simple form r = 2acos^. 

This is at once evident from the figure. 0| 

For, if OCA be a diameter, we have 

0P=0^ cos ^, 

i.e. r=2aQO8 0. 

173. The equation (1) of Art. 171 is a quadratic 
equation which, for any given value of 6, gives two 
values of r. These two values in the figure are OP and 
OQ. 

If these two values be called r-^ and rg, we have, from 
equation (1), 

7\r^ = product of the roots — E^ — a"^, 

i.e. OP.OQ^P'-a\ 

The value of the rectangle OP . OQ is therefore the 
same for all values of 0. It follows that if we drew any 
other line through to cut the circle in P^ and Q^ we 
should have OP . OQ = OP^ .OQ^. 

This is Euc. iii. 36, Cor. 




POLAR EQUATION TO THE TANGENT. 147 

174. Find the equation to the chord joining the points on the circle 
r — 2a cos 6 whose vectorial angles are d^ and 6^, and deduce the equation 
to the tangent at the point 6^. 

The equation to any straight line in polar coordinates is (Art. 88) 

^ = rcos((9-a) (1). 

If this pass through the points (2a; cos ^j^, 6^ and (2asin^2» ^2)' ^^^ 
have 

2a cos d-^ cos (^j-a)=^ = 2acos ^.3 cos {9.^~a) (2). 

Hence cos (2^^ - a) + cos a = cos (2^., - a) + cos a, 

i.e. 2^1 -a= -(2^0 -a), 

since d^ and ^2 ^^^ iiot» i'^ general, equal. 

Hence a — d-^ + d.^^ 

and then, from (2), j? = 2a cos 6-^ cos d.-^. 

On substitution in (1), the equation to the required chord is 

r cos (^ - ^1 - ^2) = 2a cos ^1 cos ^2 (3). 

The equation to the tangent at the point d^ is found, as in 
Art. 150, by putting 6^ = 6^ in equation (3). 

We thus obtain as the equation to the tangent 

rcos (^-2^^) — 2acos2^j^. • 

As in the foregoing article it could be shewn that the equation to 
the chord joining the points d^ and 6^ on the circle r= 2a cos {d - 7) is 

r cos {d -9-^- 6., + 7] — 2a cos {9-^ - 7) cos (9.^ - 7) 

and hence that the equation to the tangent at the point ^^ is 

r cos (^ - 2^j + 7) = 2a cos2 (^j - 7).

8. Find the condition that the straight line

175. To find the general equation to a circle referred to 
oblique axes which meet at an angle to. 

Let C be the centre and a the radius of the circle. Let 
the coordinates of C be (h, k) so 
that if CM, drawn parallel to the 
axis of 2/, meets OX in M, then 

OM=h and MC=.k. 
Let P be any point on the 
circle whose coordinates are x and 
y. Draw PN, the ordinate of P, 
and CL parallel to OX to meet 
PNinL. 

Then CL = MN = OiV - OM =- x - h, 

and LP^NP-NL^NP -MG^y- k. 

Also z CLP - z ONP= 180° - z PNX = 180° - tu. 

Hence, since CL^- + LP^ - WL . LP cos CLP = a\ 
we have (x - h)2 + (y - k)2 + 2 (x -- h) (y - k) cosco = 3?, 
i.e. x^ + y^ + 2xy cos w - 2x [h + k cos w) ~2y ik + h cos w)

The required equation is therefore found. 

176. As in Art. 142 it may be shewn that the 
equation

represents a circle and its radius and centre found. 




OBLIQUE COORDINATES. J 49 

Ex. If the axes he inclined at 60°, prove that the equation 

x^ + xy+i/-^x-5y -2 — (1) 

represents a circle and find its centre and radius. 

If w be equal to 60°, so that cosw=|, the equation of Art. 175 

D6COII1GS 

x'^ + xy-&gt;ry--x{2h + Tc)-y{2k + h) + h'^ + l'^ + hh = a:^. 
This equation agrees with (1) if 

2/i + /c = 4 (2), 

'ih + h^b (3), 

and 7i2 + A;2 + 7i;e-a2= -2 (4). 

Solving (2) and (3), we have h = l and k — 2. Equation (4) then 
gives 

- a2^7t2+F + ;iA; + 2z^9, 

so that a = 3. 

The equation (1) therefore represents a circle whose centre is the 
point (1, 2) and whose radius is 3, the axes being inclined at 60°. 

EXAMPLES. XXI. 

Find the inclinations of the axes so that the following equations

150 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Coordinates of a point on a circle expressed in 
terms of one single variable. 

177. If, in the figure of Art. 139, we put the angle 
MOP equal to a, the coordinates of the point P are easily 
seen to be a cos a and a sin a. 

These equations clearly satisfy equation (1) of that 
article. 

The position of the point P is therefore known when 
the value of a is given, and it may be, for brevity, called 
" the point a." 

With the ordinary Cartesian coordinates we have to 
give the values of two separate quantities x and y' (which 
are however connected by the relation x' = Ja^ — y"^) to 
express the position of a point P on the circle. The 
above substitution therefore often simplifies solutions of 
problems. 

178. To find tlie equation to the straight line joining 
two joints, a and y8, 07i the circle xr + y^ = a-. 

Let the points be P and Q, and let OA^ be the perpen- 
dicular from the origin on the straight line PQ ; then OJV 
bisects the angle POQ, and hence 

z X0]^= 1 ( z XOP + L XOQ) = H« + ^)- 
Also OK^ OP cos NOP = a cos °^^ . 

The equation to PQ is therefore (Art. 53), 

a + j8 . a+ i8 a — /? 

X cos — p-^" + y sm — ^ - — a cos — - . 
2 -^ 2 2 

If we put P = a we have, as the equation to the tangent 
at the point a, 

X cos a + y sin a = a. 

This may also be deduced from the equation of Art. 150 
by putting x' = a cos a and y =cb sin a. 

179. If the equation to the circle be in the more 
general form 

(x - hy + (y-ky^ a', (Art. 1 40), 



THE CIRCLE. ONE VARIABLE. 151 

we may express the coordinates of F in the form 

(A + (X cos a, ^ + ct sin a). 

For these values satisfy the above equation. 

Here a is the angle LOP [Fig. Art. 140]. 

The equation to the straight line joining the points a and 
^ can be easily shewn to be 

/ IN « + yS / 7\ • a + )8 a. — ^ 

{x — h) cos — ^r^ -^ {y — Ic) sm — ^ — = a cos — ^ , 

and so the tangent at the point a is 

{x — K) cos a + (2/ — li) sin a = a. 

#180. Ex. Find the four common tangents to the two circles 
ox'^ + 5i/ - 22x + iy + 20 = 0, 
and 5a;2 + 5?/2 + 22a; -4y- 20 = 0. 

The equations may be written 

and (x + \^-f+{y-ir^ = SK 

Any point on the first circle is (\^- + cos d, -| + sin d). 

Any point on the second is ( - V- + 3 cos 0, f + 3 sin 0). 

The equations to the tangents at these points are by the last 
article 

(a;- i^)cos^ + {y + |)sin^ = l (1), 

and (a; + -V-)eos0 + (?/-|)sin0 = 3 (2). 

These tangents coincide, in which case we have the common 
tangents, if 

cos ^ _ sin ^ _ - 11 cos ^ + 2 sin ^ - 5 

cos &lt;p ~ sin 9f&gt; ~~ 11 cos 0-2 sin 0-15 ^ ^' 

From the first pair of these equations we have (f) — dor(p = d + 180°. 

If 0=:^, the second pair gives 

-llcos^ + 2sin^-5 
~ llcos^-2sin^-l"5 ' 

i.e. llcos^-2sin^ = 5 (4), 

i.e. Il-2tan^ = 5^1 + tan2^. 

On solving, we have tan ^ = | or - -^^. 



152 COOEDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Corresponding to tan^ = | we have the values sin ^ = 4, cos^ = f 
which satisfy (4) ; we have also the values sin ^= - 1 and cos ^= - f , 
which do not satisfy it. 

Corresponding to tan^= --y-&gt; t^ie values which satisfy (4) are 

sin^= -ff and cos^=/6. 
If = 180°+ ^, the second pair of equations (3) give 
- 11 cos ^ + 2 sin ^ - 5 
~ -llcos^ + 2sin^-15' 

i,e. 11 cos (9 -2 sin ^= -10 (5). 

This gives (ll-2tan ^)2= 100(1 + tan2 6&gt;), 

so that tan^=-for^. 

The corresponding values which satisfy (5) are found to be 

sin 0=1, cos0=-| and sin^=-^t., cos0=-||. 

The solutions of (3) are therefore 

sin0=f, -i^, f, and -^^; 

cos = 1, 2^5, -I, and -ff. 

On substituting these values in equation (1), the common tangents 
are found to be 

3a; + 42/ = 10, 7.^-24?/ = 50, 

4a;-3i/= 5, and 24.^+ 7?/ = 25. 

181. We shall conclude this chapter with some mis- 
cellaneous examples on loci. 

Ex. I. Find the locus of a point P lohich moves so that its distance 
from a given point is always in a given ratio [n : 1) to its distance 
from another given point A. 

Take as origin and the direction of OA as the axis of x. Let 
the distance OA be rt, so that A is the point {a, 0). 

If {Xy y) be the coordinates of any position of P we have 
OP2=n2.^p2, 

i.e. x'^-\-y'^ = n^[{x-a)^-\-y-'\, 

i.e. (a;2 + 2/2)(n2-l)-2an2a; + 7i2a2=0 (1). 

Hence, by Art. 143, the locus of P is a circle. 

Let this circle meet the axis of x in the points C and D. Then OC 
and OB are the roots of the equation obtained by putting y equal to 
zero in (1). 

-.-.- ^ ^ na , ^ ^ na 

Hence 00= and 0D= 5.

We therefore have 



CA= and AD = 



n+1 n-1 

OG OB 
^^^^^ GA=AD = ''- 

The points C and D therefore divide the line OA in the given ratio, 
and the required circle is on CD as diameter. 

Ex. 2. From any 'point on one given circle tangents are drawn to 
another given circle ; prove that the locus of the middle point of the 
chord of contact is a third circle. 

Take the centre of the first circle as origin and let the axis of x 
pass through the centre of the second circle. Their equations are 
then 

a;2+2/2=a2 (1), 

and (.'c-c)2 + r/2 = &amp;2 (2), 

where a and b are the radii, and c the distance between the centres, of 
the circles. 

Any point on (1) is {a cos 6, a sin 6) where is variable. Its chord 
of contact with respect to (2) is 

{x - c) {a cos 9 - c) -{-ya ^m 6 = 1^ (3) . 

The middle point of this chord of contact is the point where it is 
met by the perpendicular from the centre, viz. the point (c, 0). 

The equation to this perpendicular is (Art. 70) 

-{x-c)a sin 6 + [a cos 6 -c)y = (4). 

Any equation deduced from (3) and (4) is satisfied by the coordi- 
nates of the point under consideration. If we eliminate 6 from them, 
we shall have an equation always satisfied by the coordinates of the 
point, whatever be the value of 6. The result will thus be the equation 
to the required locus. 

Solving (3) and (4), we have 

• /I ^^y 

a Bin 6 = 

and a cos 6 - c 



7/ + (.r-6f'

so that acos^ = c+ „ , 

y^ + {x- cy 

Hence 

a2 = a2 cos2 e + a^ sm^ e = c'^ + 2ch^ ^ ^~^ ^, + ^ . 

y^+(x- c)- y^ + {x - c)2 

The required locus is therefore 

(a2 - c2) [?/2 + (.^ _ c)2] = 2c62 [x -c) + ¥. 
This is a circle and its centre and radius are easily found. 



154 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Ex. 3. Find the locus of a point P which is such that its polar with 
respect to one circle touches a second circle. 

Taking the notation of the last article, the equations to the two 
circles are 

x^ + if=a- (1), 

and (a?-c)2 + ^2^62 (2). 

Let {h, Jc) he the coordinates of any position of P. Its polar with 
respect to (1) is 

xh + yk = a^ (3), 

Also any tangent to (2) has its equation of the form (Art. 179) 

[x - c) cos d + y sin d = b (4). 

If then (3) be a tangent to (2) it must be of the form (4). 

^, „ cos d sin 9 c cos d + b 

Therefore — - — = — ^ — = ,5 .

These equations give 

cos 6 {a^-ch) = hh, and sin d{a^-ch) = hk. 

Squaring and adding, we have 

(a2-c7i)2=62(/i2+^2) (5). 

The locus of the point {h, k) is therefore the curve 
h'^{x^ + y^) = {a^-cxf. 

Aliter. The condition that (3) may touch (2) may be otherwise 
found. 

For, as in Art. 153, the straight line (3) meets the circle (2) in the 
points whose abscissae are given by the equation 

k^{x-c)^ + {a^-hxf^b%\ 

i. e. x^- {h^ + F) - 2x {ck^ + a'^h) + [k^c"^ + a" - b'^k^) = 0. 

The line (3) will therefore touch (2) if 

(cZ;2 + a^hf={h^ + F) (Fc^ + a^- b^k% 

i.e. a h^h^ + B) = {ch-aY-, 

which is equation (5). 

Ex. 4. is a fixed point and P any point on a given circle ; OP 
is joined and on it a point Q is taken so that OP . OQ = a constant 
quantity k- ; prove that the locus of Q is a circle which becomes a 
straight line ivhen lies on the original circle. 




THE CIRCLE. EXAMPLES. 155 

Let O be taken as pole and the line through the centre C as the 
initial line. Let OC = d, and let the 
radius of the circle be a. Qyf\ 

The equation to the circle is then 

a2 = 7-2 + d^ - 2rd cos d, (Art. 171), Q \d C" 

where OP=r and lPOG = d. 

Let OQ be p, so that, by the given 

condition, we have rp-=k' and hence ?- = — . 

P 

Substituting this value in the equation to the circle, we have 

a2=^VtZ2-2— cos^ (1), 

so that the equation to the locus of Q is 

' -2 55 2^cos^=- (2. 

But the equation to a circle, whose radius is a' and whose centre is 
on the initial line at a distance d', is 

r2-2rd'cos0 = a'2-d'2 (3). 

Comparing (1) and (2), we see that the required locus is a circle, 
such that 

Z'2/7 hi 

,r- and n"^ d'^- 

Hence a 2= __ -^, ^^^^^.^ - 1 J = ^-^ . 

The required locus is therefore a circle, of radius ~z^ ^ , whose 

d^ - a" 

kH 

centre is on the same line as the original centre at a distance — ^ ^ 

'^ d-- a^ 

from the fixed point. 

When lies on the original circle the distance d is equal to a, and 
the equation (1) becomes k'^ — 2drQ05dy i.e., in Cartesian coordinates, 

_fc2 

In this case the required locus is a straight line perpendicular 
to OG. 

When a second curve is obtained from a given curve by the above 
geometrical process, the second curve is said to be the inverse of the 
first curve and the fixed point O is called the centre of inversion. 

The inverse of a circle is therefore a circle or a straight line 
according as the centre of inversion is not, or is, on the circumference 
of the original circle. 



156 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Ex. 5. PQ is a straight line drawn through O, one of the common 
points of two circles, and meets them'again in P and Q; find the locus of 
the point S ivhich bisects the line PQ. 

Take O as the origin, let the radii of the two circles be R and R', 
and let the lines joining their centres to O make angles a and a' with 
the initial line. 

The equations to the two circles are therefore, {Art. 172 (2)}, 

r=2i?cos{^-a), and r = 2R' cos{d- a'). 

Hence, if S be the middle point of PQ, we have 

20S =0P+0Q = 2R cos {d-a) + 2R' cos {6- a'). 

The locus of the point S is therefore 

r = Rcos{d-a) + R'co3{e-a') 

= {R cos a + R' cos a') cos ^ + (JR sin a + R' sin a'} sin 6 

= 2R''co8{d-a") (1), 

where 2R" cos a" = R cos a + R' cos a', 

and 2R" sin a" =Rsma + R' sin a'. 



Hence R" = i s/R^ + R'^ + 2RR' cos (a - a') , 

R sin a + R' sin a' 



and tana"= 



jR cos a + jR' cos a' ' 



From (1) the locus of S is a circle, whose radius is JR", which 
passes through the origin and is such that the line joining O to its 
centre is inclined at an angle a" to the initial line.

182. Orthogonal Circles. 

said to intersect orthogonally when 
the tangents at their points of 
intersection are at right angles. 

If the two circles intersect at 
P, the radii O^P and O.^P., which 
are perpendicular to the tangents 
at P, must also be at right angles. 



Def. Two circles are 




Hence 



O^Oi=O^P^-vO.JP\ 



i.e. the square of the distance between the centres must be 
equal to the sum of the squares of the radii. 

Also the tangent from Oo, to the other circle is equal to 
the radius a^,, i.e. if two circles be orthogonal the length of 
the tangent drawn from the centre of one circle to the 
second circle is equal to the radius of the first. 

Either of these two conditions will determine whether 
the circles are orthogonal. 

The centres of the circles 

a;2 + 2/2 + 2f;^ + 2/?/ + c = and a;- + ?/2 + 2^'a; + 2/'y + c' = 0, 

are the points {-g, -/) and (-^', -/') ; also the squares of their 
radii are g^+f~- c and g'^ +f'^ - c'. 



RADICAL AXIS OF TWO CIRCLES. 161 

They therefore cut orthogonally if 

i.e. if 2gg' + 2ff=c + c'. 

1S3. Radical Axis. Def. The radical axis of 
two circles is the locus of a point which moves so that the 
lengths of the tangents drawn from it to the two circles are 
equal. 

Let the equations to the circles be 

x' + y' + 2gx + 2fi/ + G^0 (1), 

and x" + i/^ + 2gjX + 2fy + c^ = (2), 

and let (x^, y^ be any point such that the tangents from it 
to these circles are equal. 

By Art. 168, we have 

^1^ + Vx + ^9^1 + 2/2/1 + c = a^i" + 2/r + 2g^x^ + 2fy^ + c^, 

i.e. 2x^{g-g,) + 2y,{f-f,) + G-C:, = 0. 

But this is the condition that the point (iCj, 2/1) should 
lie on the locus 

2x{g-g,) + 2y{f-A) + c-c, = (3). 

This is therefore the equation to the radical axis, and it 
is clearly a straight line. 

It is easily seen that the radical axis is perpendicular 
to the line joining the centres of the circles. For these 
centres are the points (— g, -f) and (-^1, — /i)- The 

"m" of the line ioining them is therefore -^ — 7 {, 

^ ^ -9x-{-9) 

i.e. -tA. 
9-9i 

The "?7i" of the line (3) is - 7— §. 

The product of these two " m's " is - 1 . 

Hence, by Art. 69, the radical axis and the line joining 
the centres are perpendicular.

If the circles intersect in real points, F and Q^ as in

If they do not intersect in real points, as in the second

that the tangents TR and TS are equal in length.

straight line O^O^ into parts whose difference is constant. 

Therefore, since O^OT is a right angle, the locus of T, 
i.e. the radical axis, is a fixed straight line perpendicular to 
the line joining the centres.

RADICAL AXIS. 163 

185. If the equations to the circles in Art. 183 be 
written in the form aS'=0 and aS" = 0, the equation (3) to 
the radical axis may be written S — S' = 0, and therefore 
the radical axis passes through the common points, real or 
imaginary, of the circles S = and aS" = 0. 

In the last article we saw that this was true geometri- 
cally for the case in which the circles meet in real points. 

When the circles do not geometrically intersect, as in 
Fig. 2, we must then look upon the straight line TO as 
passing through the imaginary points of intersection of the 
two circles. 

186. The radical axes of tJwee circles^ taken in 2)cdrs^ 
meet iri a j^oint. 

Let the equations to the three circles be 

^ = (1), 

'S^'^O (2), 

and S"=^0 (3). 

The radical axis of the circles (1) and (2) is the straight 
line 

S-&gt;S' = (4). 

The radical axis of (2) and (3) is the straight line 

.S"-.S"'=:0 (5). 

If we add equation (5) to equation (4) we shall have the 
equation of a straight line through their points of inter- 
section. 

Hence .S'-aS'"-0 (6) 

is a straight line through the intersection of (4) and (5). 

But (6) is the radical axis of the circles (3) and (1). 

Hence the three radical axes of the three circles, taken 
in pairs, meet in a point. 

This point is called the Radical Centre of the three 
circles. 

This may also be easily proved geometrically. For let 
the three circles be called A, B, and C, and let the radical 
axis of A and B and that of B and C meet in a point 0.

164 COORDINATE GEOMETKY. 

By the definition of the radical axis, the tangent from 

to the circle A = the tansrent from ^---^

from to the circle B = tangent z'^' \ ^^\^^ 

from it to the circle C. f \ Ip 

Hence the tangent from to &gt;v ^/^v^' /^"^^ 

the circle A = the tangent from it ^^7\ \ \

circles A and C. — 

187. If S=0 and S' = he the equations of two circles, 
the equation of any circle through their 2&gt;oints of inter- 
section is S — \S'. Also the equation to any circle, such that 
the radical axis of it and S—0 is u = 0, is S + \u ~ 0. 

For wherever S =0 and &gt;S" = are both satisfied the 
equation S = XS' is clearly satisfied, so that S = \S' is some 
locus through the intersections of aS' = and *S"= 0. 

Also in both S and S' the coefiicients of x^ and y'^ are 
equal and the coefiicient of xy is zero. The same statement 
is therefore true for the equation S=XS'. Hence the 
proposition. 

Again, since u is only of the first degree, therefore in 
S + Xu the coefficients of ay^ and y^ are equal and the 
coefficient of xy is zero, so that S + Xu = is clearly a circle. 
Also it passes through the intersections of *S^ = and u — 0.

188. Coaxal Circles. Def. A system of circles 
is said to be coaxal when they have a common radical axis, 
i.e. when the radical axis of each pair of circles of the 
system is the same. 

Tojind the equation of a system of coaxal circles. 

Since, by Art. 183, the radical axis of any pair of the 
circles is perpendicular to the line joining their centres, it 
follows that the centres of all the circles of a coaxal system 
must lie on a straight line which is perpendicular to the 
radical axis. 

Take the line of centres as the axis of x and the radical 
axis as the axis of y (Figs. I. and II., Art. 190), so that 
is the origin. 

The equation to any circle with its centre on the axis 
of £c is 

x^ + y'^ — 2gx + c-0 (1). 

Any point on the radical axis is (0, y^). 

The square on the tangent from it to the circle (1) is, 
by Art. 168, y^' + c. 

Since this quantity is to be the same for all circles of 
the system it follows that c is the same for all such circles ; 
the different circles are therefore obtained by giving dif- 
ferent values to g in the equation (1). 

The intersections of (1) with the radical axis are then 
obtained by putting a^ = in equation (1), and we have 

If c be negative, we have two real points of intersection 
as in Fig. I. of Art. 190. In such cases the circles are said 
to be of the Intersecting Species. 

If c be positive, we have two imaginary points of in- 
tersection as in Fig. II. 



'&amp;• 



189. Limiting points of a coaxal system. 

The equation (1) of the previous article which gives any 
circle of the system may be written in the form 

(x-gY + 2/2 ^ / - c = [Jf - cf. 



COAXAL CIRCLES.

It therefore represents a circle whose centre is the point 
(^, 0) and whose radius is J g^ — c. 

This radius vanishes, i.e. the circle becomes a point- 
circle, when g^ — G, i.e. when g — ±Jc. 

Hence at the particular points (+ Jc, 0) we have point- 
circles which belong to the system. These point-circles are 
called the Limiting Points of the system. 

If G be negative, these points are imaginary. 

But it was shown in the last article that when c is 
negative the circles intersect in real points as in Fig. I., 
Art. 190. 

If c be positive, the limiting points L^ and L^ (Fig. II.) are 
real, and in this case the circles intersect in imaginary points. 

The limiting points are therefore real or imaginary 
according as the circles of the system intersect in imaginary 
or real points. 

190. Orthogonal circles of a coaxal system. 

Let T be any point on the common radical axis 
of a system of coaxal circles, and let TR be the tangent 
from it to any circle of the system. 




Then a circle, whose centre is T and whose radius is TR^ 
will cut each circle of the coaxal system orthogonally. 



168 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



[For the radius TR of this circle is at right angles to 
the radius O^R, and so for its intersection with any other 
circle of the system.] 




Fig. II. 

Hence the limiting points (being point- c^rcZes of the 
system) are on this orthogonal circle. 

The limiting points are therefore the intersections with 
the line of centres of any circle whose centre is on the 
common radical axis and whose radius is the tangent from 
it to any of the circles of the system. 

Since, in Eig. I,, the limiting points are imaginary these 
orthogonal circles do not meet the line of centres in real 
points. 

In Fig. II. they jDass through the limiting points Z^ 
and 7^2 . 

These orthogonal circles (since they all pass through two 
points, real or imaginary) are therefore a coaxal system. 

Also if the original circles, as in Fig. I., intersect in 
real points, the orthogonal circles intersect in imaginary 
points; in Fig. II. the original circles intersect in imaginary 
points, and the orthogonal circles in real points. 

We therefore have the following theorem : 
A set of coaxal circles can be cut orthogonally hy another 
set of coaxal circles, the centres of each set lying on the 
radical axis of the other set ; also one set is of the limiting- 
point sjyecies and the other set of the other species. 



ORTHOGONAL CIRCLES. 169 

191. Without reference to the limiting points of the original 
system, it may be easily found whether or not the orthogonal circles 
meet the original line of centres. 

For the circle, whose centre is T and whose radius is TR, meets 
or does not meet the line 0-fi,2 according as TR^ is &gt; or &lt; TO^, 

i.e. according as TO^^-O^R^ is &gt; TO^, 

L e. according as TO^ +00^^- 0-fi^ is &gt; TO^, 

i.e. according as 00-^ is &lt; O^R, 

i.e. according as the radical axis is without, or within, each of the 
circles of the original system. 

192. In the next article the above results will be 
proved analytically. 

To find the equation to any circle y)hich cuts two ghien 
circles orthogonally. 

Take the radical axis of the two circles as the axis of y^ 
so that their equations may be written in the form 

a? ^y^ — 2gx + c = (1), 

and a? 4- y'^ — 2g^x +c — (2), 

the quantity c being the same for each. 

Let the equation to any circle which cuts them or- 
thogonally be 

{x-Ay + {y-Bf = E^ ....(3). 

The equation (1) can be written in the form 

{x-gf + f-^[J^::rcy (4). 

The circles (3) and (4) cut orthogonally if the square of 
the distance between their centres is equal to the sum of 
the squares of their radii, 

i.e. if {A - gf ^E^-^m^. [V/^]^ 

i.e. if A^-^B'-1Ag = R^-c (5). 

Similarly, (3) will cut (2) orthogonally if 

A--vB''-'lAg^ = E'-c (6). 

Subtracting (6) from (5), we have A (g - g^) ^^^ 0. 

Hence ^ = 0, and i?- = B^ + c. 



170 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Substituting these values in (3), the equation to the 
required orthogonal circle is 

ar^ + 2/'-2%-c = (7), 

where B is any quantity whatever. 

Whatever be the value of B the equation (7) represents 
a circle whose centre is on the axis of y and which passes 
through the points (+ Jc, 0). 

But the latter points are the limiting points of the 
coaxal system to which the two circles belong. [Art. 189.] 

Hence any pair of circles belonging to a coaxal system 
is cut at right angles by any circle of another coaxal 
system ; also the centres of the circles of the latter system 
lie on the common radical axis of the original system, and 
all the circles of the latter system pass through the limiting 
points (real or imaginary) of the first system. 

Also the centre of the circle (7) is the point (0, B) and 
its radius is JB"^ + c. 

. The square of the tangent drawn from (0, B) to the 
circle {I) = B"" + c (by Art. 168). 

Hence the radius of any circle of the second system is 
equal to the length of the tangent drawn from its centre to 
any circle of the first system. 

193. The equation to the system of circles which cut 
a given coaxal system orthogonally may also be obtained 
by using the result of Art. 182. 

For any circle of the coaxal system is, by Art. 188, 
given by 

a? + y'^- Igx + c = (1), 

where c is the same for all circles. 

Any point on the radical axis is (0, y). 

The square on the tangent drawn from it to (1) is 
therefore y"^ + c. 

The equation to any circle cutting (1) orthogonally is 
therefore 

^^ + (2/ - 2/T = y"" + ^' 

i.e. x^ + y'^— lyy —c = 0. 



ORTHOGONAL CIRCLES. 171 

Whatever be the value of y this circle passes through 

the points (+ ^]c, 0), i.e. through the limiting points of the 
system of circles given by (1). 

194. We can now deduce an easy construction for the 
circle that cuts any three circles orthogonally. 

Consider the three circles in the figure of Art. 186. 

By Art. 192 any circle cutting A and B orthogonally 
has its centre on their common radical axis, i.e. on the 
straight line OD. 

Similarly any circle cutting B and C orthogonally has 
its centre on the radical axis OE. 

Any circle cutting all three circles orthogonally must 
therefore have its centre at the intersection of OD and OE., 
i.e. at the radical centre 0. Also its radius must be the 
length of the tangent dravi^n from the radical centre to 
any one of the three circles. 

Ex. Find the equation to the circle lohich cuts orthogonally each 
of the three circles 

x^ + 'ij^ + 2x + ny+ 4 = (1), 

x'^ + 2/ + lx+ 6y + ll = (2), 

x^ + if- x + 22y+ 3 = (3). 

The radical axis of (1) and (2) is 

5x-lly + 7 = 0. 
The radical axis of (2) and (3) is 

8x-l&amp;y + 8 = 0. 
These two straight Hnes meet in the point (3, 2) which is therefore 
the radical centre. 

The square of the length of the tangent from the point (3, 2) to 
each of the given circles =57. 

The required equation is therefore {x - 3)^ +{y - 2)^ = 57, 
i. e. x^ + ?/2 — 6a; - 4?/ - 44 = 0. 

195. Ex. Find the locus of a point which moves so that the length 
of the tangent draion from it to one given circle is X times the length of 
the tangent from it to another given circle. 

As in Art. 188 take as axes of x and y the line joining the centres 
of the two circles and the radical axis. The equations to the two 
circles are therefore 

x'^ + y''-2g^x + c = Q (1), 

and a;2 + ^2_2^^a; + c = (2). 



172 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Let (h, k) be a point such that the length of the tangent from it to 

(1) is always X times the length of the tangent from it to (2). 

Then Ji^ + k^- 2gji + c = \^ [/i^ + A;^ - ^.g^h + c]. 

Hence {h, h) always lies on the circle 

x'^ + y^-&lt;ix^-^^ + cr=0 (3). 

A"' — 1 

This circle is clearly a circle of the coaxal system to which (1) and 

(2) belong. 

Again, the centre of (1) is the point (f/^, 0), the centre of (2) is 

(^2, 0), whilst the centre of (3) is ( ^toZ\^ ' ^) ' 

Hence, if these three centres be called O^ , 0.^ , and O3 , we have 

"\ 2 1 

and O^Os = "^^ _ { ^ ~ ^3 = -^YZi (^2 " ^i)&gt; 

so that O1O3 : 0^0^ : : X^ : 1. 

The required locus is therefore a circle coaxal with the two given 
circles and whose centre divides externally, in the ratio X" : 1, the line 
joining the centres of the two given circles.

10. From the preceding question shew that the centres of simili-

CONIC SECTIONS. 



CHAPTER X. 



THE PARABOLA. 



196. Conic Section. Def. The locus of a point 
P, which moves so that its distance from a fixed point is 
always in a constant ratio to its perpendicular distance 
from a fixed straight line, is called a Conic Section. 

The fixed point is called the Focus and is usually 
denoted by S. 

The constant ratio is called the Eccentricity and is 
denoted by e. 

The fixed straight line is called the Directrix. 

The straight line passing through the Focus and per- 
pendicular to the Directrix is called the Axis. 

When the eccentricity e is equal to unity, the Conic 
Section is called a Parabola. 

When e is less than unity, it is called an SUipse. 

When e is greater than unity, it is called a Hyper- 
bola. 

[The name Conic Section is derived from the fact that 
these curves were first obtained by cutting a cone in 
various ways.] 



THE PARABOLA. 



175 




197. To find the equation to a Farahola. 

Let S be the fixed point and ZM the directrix. We 
require therefore the locus 
of a point F which moves 
so that its distance from S 
is always equal to PM, its 
perpendicular distance from 
ZM. 

Draw 8Z perpendicular 
to the directrix and bisect 
8Z in the point A ; produce 
ZA to X, 

The point A is clearly a 
point on the curve and is 
called the Vertex of the 
Parabola. 

Take A as origin, AX as the axis of x, and J.F, 
perpendicular to it, as the axis of y. 

Let the distance ZA^ or A8^ be called «, and let P be 
any point on the curve whose coordinates are x and y. 

Join /S'P, and draw PN and PM perpendicular respec- 
tively to the axis and directrix. 

We have then aSP^ = Pif ^ 

^.e. {x - of + 2/2 r= ZN'' = {a + xf, 

y2 = 4ax (1). 

This being the relation which exists between the co- 
ordinates of any point P on the parabola is, by Art. 42, the 
equation to the parabola. 

Cor. The equation (1) is equivalent to the geometrical 
proposition 

PN^ = 4:AS.AIi. 

198. The equation of the preceding article is the 
simplest possible equation to the parabola. Throughout 
this chapter this standard form of the equation is assumed 
unless the contrary is stated. 



176 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

If instead of AX and A Y we take the axis and the 
directrix ^M as the axes of coordinates, the equation 
would be 

(x — 2a)- + y^ = x", 

i.e. y'^ = ia{x — a) (1). 

Similarly, if the axis SX and a perpendicular line SL 
be taken as the axes of coordinates, the equation is 

aj2 + 2/2 = (a? + 2a)2, 

i.e. y^ = 4:a(x + a) (2). 

These two equations may be deduced from the equation 
of the previous article by transforming the origin, firstly to 
the point (- a, 0) and secondly to the point (a, 0). 

199. The equation to the parabola referred to any focus and 
directrix may be easily obtained. Thus the equation to the parabola, 
whose focus is the point' (2, 3) and whose directrix is the straight 
line X - 4y + S — 0, is 



i. e. 17 [x^ + y^ - ix - 62/ + 13] :== [x^ + 16i/ + 9 - 8xy + Gx - 24.y] , 
i.e. 16x'^ + y^ + 8xy-7ix-78y + 212 = 0. 

200. To trace the curve 

2/2= iax (1). 

If X be negative, the corresponding values of y are 
imaginary (since the square root of a negative quantity is 
unreal) ; hence there is no part of the curve to the left of 
the point A. 

If y be zero, so also is x, so that the axis of x meets 
the curve at the point A only. 

If X be zero, so also is y, so that the axis of y meets 
the curve at the point A only. 

For every positive value of x we see from (1), by taking 
the square root, that y has two equal and opposite values. 

Hence corresponding to any point P on the curve there 
is another point P' on the other side of the axis which is 
obtained by producing PN to P' so that PN and NP' are 



THE PARABOLA. 177 

equal in magnitude. The line PP' is called a double 
ordinate. 

As X increases in magnitude, so do the corresponding 
values of y ; finally, when x becomes infinitely great, y 
becomes infinitely great also. 

By taking a large number of values of x and the 
corresponding values of y it will be found that the curve is 
as in the figure of Art. 197. 

The two branches never meet but are of infinite length. 

201. The quantity y"^ — 4aa;' is negative^ zero, or positive 
according as the point {x\ y') is within, upon, or without the 
parabola. 

Let Q be the point {x , y') and let it be within the 
curve, i.e. be between the curve and the axis AX. Draw 
the ordinate QN and let it meet the curve in P. 

Then (by Art. 197), PN^ - la . a;'. 

Hence y"^, i.e. QN^, is &lt; PiV^, and hence is &lt; iax . 

.'. y'^ — 4:ax is negative. 
Similarly, if Q be without the curve, then y"-^, i.e. QJV% 
is &gt; PN^j and hence is &gt; 4iax'. 

Hence the proposition. 

202. Latus Rectum. Def. The latus rectum of 
any conic is the double ordinate LSL' drawn through the 
focus S. 

In the case of the parabola we have SL = distance of L 
from the directrix — SZ= 2a. 

Hence the latus rectum = la. 

"When the latus rectum is given it follows that the 
equation to the parabola is completely known in its 
standard form, and the size and shape of the curve 
determined. 

The quantity la is also often called the principal 
parameter of the curve. 

Focal Distance of any point. The focal distance 
of any point P is the distance 8P. 

This focal distance = PM = ZN= ZA+AN'=a + x. 
L. 12 



178 COORDINATE GEOMETEY. 

Ex. Find the vertex, axis, focus, and latus rectum of the parabola

The equation can be written 

y^-5y=-Sx--^^, 
i.e. {y--^f=-Sx-s^- + ^^=-3{x + i). 

Transform this equation to the point (-|, f) and it becomes 
y^= -Sx, which represents a parabola, whose axis is the axis of x 
and whose concavity is turned towards the negative end of this axis. 
Also its latus rectum is 3. 

Eef erred to the original axes the vertex is the point i-^, f ), the 
axis is 2/ = f, and the focus is the point (-| -|, f), «-e. ( -V-i f)-

parabola IS - + ,^^=1, 

203. To find the points of intersection of any straight 
line with the parabola 

2/^ = 4acc (1). 

The equation to any straight line is 

y = 7nx + c .(2). 

The coordinates of the points common to the straight 
line and the parabola satisfy both equations (1) and (2), 
and are therefore found by solving them. 

12—2 



180 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Substituting the value of y from (2) in (1), we have 

{mx + cf — 4:ax, 

i.e. m^oc^ + 2x (mc - 2a) + G^ - (3). 

This is a quadratic equation for x and therefore has two 
roots, real, coincident, or imaginary. 

The straight line therefore meets the parabola in two 
points, real, coincident, or imaginary. 

The roots of (3) are real or imaginary according as 

{2(mc-2a)f-47^iV 

is positive or negative, i.e. according as — aTnc + a^ is 
positive or negative, i.e. according as mc is ^ ia. 

204. To find the length of the chord intercepted by the parabola on 
the straight line 

y — mx + c (1). 

If (o^i , y-^ and {x^, y^) he the common points of intersection, then, 
as in Art. 154, we have, from equation (3) of the last article, 

{^x^ — x^j = (ajj + x^) — ^x^x^ 

_4(mc-2a)^ 4:C^ _l&amp;a{a-mc) 

~ m* m^ wi'* ' 

and yj^-y^ = m{x^-x^). 

Hence the required length = \/(l/i - 2/2)^ + (^1 ~ ^"2)^ 

= Jl + m'-^ (x^ - ajg) = ^2 Jl + mP J a (a - mc). 

205. To find the equation to the tangent at any point 
(^'3 y) 9f i^^^ parabola y^ = 4:ax. 

The definition of the tangent is given in Art. 149. 

Let P be the point [x, y) and Q a point (x", y") on the 
parabola. 

The equation to the line PQ is 

2/-y' = f5f'(^-»'') (!)• 

Since P and Q both lie on the curve, we have 

y'^^4ax' (2), 

and y"^^4.aa/' (3). 



TANGENT AT ANY POINT OF A PARABOLA. 181 
Hence, by subtraction, we have 





2/"' - y"' ^ 4a (x" - x), 


i.e. 


{y"-y'){y" + y') = 4.a{x"-x'), 


and hence 


y" -y 4o&amp; 



X —X y -^ y 

Substituting this value in equation (1), we have, as 
the equation to any secant PQ^ 

4a 

i.e. y {y + y") = ^ax + y'y" + y^ — 4:ax 

— iax + y'y" (4). 

To obtain the equation of the tangent at (x\ y') we take 
Q indefinitely close to P, and hence, in the limit, put y" = y . 

The equation (4) then becomes 

^yy — y"^ + 4aa; = 4^ax + 4aa;', 
i.e. yy' = 2a(x + x'). 

Cor. It will be noted that the equation to the tangent 
is obtained from the equation to the curve by the rule of 
Art. 152. 

Exs. The equation to the tangent at the point {2, -4) of the 
parabola y^=Qx is 

2/(-4) = 4(a; + 2), 

i.e. x-\-y + 1 = 0. 

The equation to the tangent at the point ( — 2 » — ) of the parabola 

y^=4iax is 

2a . f a\ 
y . — = 2a[x + ~] , 

d 
I.e. ii = mx-\ — .

206. To find the condition that the straight line 

y = mx + c (1) 

rtiay touch the parabola y^ — 4:ax (2). 

The abscisses of the points in which the straight line (1) 
meets the curve (2) are as in Art. 203, given by the equation 

rn^x^ + 2x {mo - 2a) + c^ = (3). 



182 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The line (1) will touch (2) if it meet it in two points 
which are indefinitely close to one another, i.e. in two 
points which ultimately coincide. 

The roots of equation (3) must therefore be equal. 

The condition for this is 

4 {mc — 2ay — iirrc^ 

i.e. ct? - amc — 0, 

a 
so that G = — . 

m 

Substituting this value of c in (1), we have as the 

equation to a tangent, 

a 
y = mx + — . 
m 

In this equation tyi is the tangent of th6 angle which 
the tangent makes with the axis of x. 

The foregoing proposition may also be obtained from the equation 
of Art. 205. 

For equation (4) of that article may be written 

la lax' ,^. 

y=—x+^ (1). 

y y 

In this equation put — , =m, i.e. y =— , 
^ y m

and hence x = -r- = ^, , and — — = — .

The equation (1) then becomes y = mx-] — . 

Also it is the tangent at the point {x', y'), i.e. (—^, — j . 

207. Equation to the normal at (x, y'). The required 

normal is the straight line which passes through the point 

{x\ y') and is perpendicular to the tangent, i.e. to the 

straight line 

2a . ,. 
yz=z—-{x + x). 

Its equation is therefore

and the equation to the normal is 

y-y'=^(x-x') 

208. To exj^ress the equation of the normal in the form 

y = mx — 2a7n — am^. 
In equation (1) of the last article put

t.e. 



y = mx — 2am — am^ 



and it is a normal at the point (am^, — 2am) of the curve. 

In this equation m is the tangent of the angle which 
the normal makes with the axis. It must be carefully 
distinguished from the m of Art. 206 which is the tangent 
of the angle which the tangent makes with the axis. The 
" m" of this article is - 1 divided by the " m'' of Art. 206. 

209. Subtangent and Subnormal. Def. If 

the tangent and normal at any point P of a conic section 
meet the axis in T and G respectively and PN be the 
ordinate at P, then NT is called the Subtangent and NG the 
Subnormal of P. 

To find the length of the subtangent and suhnorm^al. 

If P be the point {x\ y') the equation to TP is, by 
Art. 205, 

yy —2a{x-\- x) (1). 

To obtain the length of AT^ we 
have to find the point where this 
straight line meets the axis of tc, 
i.e. we put 2/ = 0in (1) and we 
have 

x=^-x (2). 

Hence AT=AN, 




184 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

[The negative sign in equation (2) shews that T and 
N always lie on opposite sides of the vertex -4.] 

Hence the subtangent iV^= 2J^iV = twice the abscissa 
of the point P. 

Since TFG is a right-angled triangle, we have (Euc. vi. 8) 

FN'^^TN.NG. 

Hence the subnormal NG 

_ PiP _ PN^ 

The subnormal is therefore constant for all points on 
the parabola and is equal to the semi-latus rectum. 

210. Ex. 1. If a chord which is normal to the parabola at one 
end subtend a right angle at the vertex, prove that it is inclined at an 
angle tan~^ ^J2 to the axis. 

The equation to any chord which is normal is 
y = mx — 2am - am^, 
i.e. mx-y = 2am+am^. 

The parabola is y^ — 4:ax. 

The straight lines joining the origin to the intersections of these 
two are therefore given by the equation 

y^ {2am + am^) - iax {mx -y) = 0. 
If these be at right angles, then 

2am + am^ — 'iam = 0, 
i.e. m= ^sJ2. 

Ex. 2. From the point where any normal to the parabola y^ = ^ax 
meets the axis is draion a line perpendicular to this normal ; prove that 
this line always touches an equal parabola. 

The equation of any normal to the parabola is 

y = mx — 2am - am^. 
This meets the axis in the point {2a + am'^, 0). 
The equation to the straight line through this point perpendicular 
to the normal is 

y = wii {x-2a — am'^) , 

where m^m= - 1. 

The equation is therefore 



y = m,[x-2a-^^, 



i.e. y = m^{x-2a) .

(a) If the tangent and normal at any point P of the 
parabola meet the axis in T and G respectively, then

COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



and the tangent at P is equally inclined to the axis and the 
focal distance of P. 




Let P be the point (x, y). 

Draw PM perpendicular to the directrix. 

By Art. 209, we have AT^AN. 

:. TS=TA + AS=^AF+ZA = ZF=MP = SP, 
and hence z STP = z SPT. 

By the same article, NG - "iAS = ZS. 

:. SG^SN-\-NG = ZS+SF=MP = SP. 

(/8) If the tangent at P meet the directrix in K, then 
KSP is a right angle. 

Por z SPT=^ L PTS=^ L KPM. 

Hence the two triangles KPS and KPM have the two 
sides KPj PS and the angle KPS equal respectively to the 
two sides KP, PM and the angle KPM. 

Hence z KSP = z KMP = a right angle. 

Also lSKP=lMKP. 

(y) Tangents at the extremities of any focal chord inter- 
sect at right angles in the directrix. 

For, if PS be produced to meet the curve in P', then, 
since z P'SK is a right angle, the tangent at P' meets the 
directrix in K 



PROPERTIES OF THE PARABOLA. 189 

Also, by (13), L MKP = z SEP, 
and, similarly, / M'KP' - L SKF. 

Hence

i. e. where x — 0. 

Hence Y lies on the tangent at the vertex. 

Also, by Euc. vi. 8, Cor., 

SY^ = SA.ST=AS.SP, 

212. To prove that through any given point {x^^ y^ 
there pass, in general, two tangents to the parabola. 

The equation to any tangent is (by Art. 206) 

y = mx -\ — ( 1 ). 

If this pass through the fixed point (x^, y^), we have 

a 
y, = TUX, + — , 

i. e. m^Xj^ — tny^ + ^ = (2). 

For any given values of x^ and y^ this equation is in 
general a quadratic equation and gives two values of m 
(real or imaginary). 

Corresponding to each value of in we have, by substi- 
tuting in (1), a different tangent. 



190 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The roots of (2) are real and different if y-^ — 4:ax-^ be 
positive, i.e., by Art. 201, if the point {x-^, y-^) lie without 
the curve. 

They are equal, i. e. the two tangents coalesce into one 
tangent, if yi— ^cix^ be zero, i.e. if the point {x-^, y^ lie on 
the curve. 

The two roots are imaginary if y^ — 4a.x\ be negative, 
i.e. if the point (cCj, y^ lie within the curve. 

213. Equation to the chord of contact of tangents 
drawn from a point {x^, y^). 

The equation to the tangent at any point Q, whose 
coordinates are x' and y', is 

yy' = 2a (x + x). 
Also the tangent at the point E, whose coordinates are 
x" and y", is 

yy" — 2a{x + x"). 

If these tangents meet at the point T, whose coordi- 
nates are x^ and y^, we have 

y^y' = 2a{x^+ x) (1) 

and y^y" = 2a{x^ + x") (2). 

The equation to QR is then 

3ryi = 2a(x + Xi) (3). 

For, since (1) is true, the point {x, y') lies on (3). 

Also, since (2) is true, the point {x", y") lies on (3). 

Hence (3) must be the equation to the straight line 
joining ix\ y) to the point {x' , y"), i. e. it must be the 
equation to QR the chord of contact of tangents from the 
point {x^, ?/i). 

214. The polar of any point with respect to a para- 
bola is defined as in Art. 162. 

To find the equation of the polar of the point [x^ , 2/1) 
with respect to the parabola y^ — ^ax. 

Let Q and R be the points in which any chord drawn 
through the point P, whose coordinates are (x^, y^), meets 
the parabola. 



THE PARABOLA. POLE AND POLAR. 



191 



Let the tangents at Q and R meet in the point whose 
coordinates are (A, k). 



T(h.Wji. 





We require the locus of (h, k). 

Since ^^ is the chord of contact of tangents from (7i, k) 
its equation (Art. 213) is 

ky = 2a(x + h). 

Since this straight line passes through the point (r^ , y^) 
we haye 

%i = 2a{x^ + h) (1). 

Since the relation (1) is true, it follows that the point 
{hj k) always lies on the straight line 

3ryi = 2a(x + xJ (2). 

Hence (2) is the equation to the polar of (ic^, y^. 

Cor. The equation to the polar of the focus, viz. the point [a, 0), 
is Q = x + a, so that the polar of the focus is the directrix. 

215. When the point (x-^,y^ lies without the parabola 
the equation to its polar is the same as the equation to the 
chord of contact of tangents drawn from [x-^^, y^). 

When (x^, y^) is on the parabola the polar is the same 
as the tangent at the point. 

As in Art. 164 the polar of (a^, y^) might have been 
defined as the chord of contact of the tangents (real or 
imaginary) that can be drawn from it to the parabola. 

216. Geometrical construction for the polar of a point 



192 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



Let T be the point {x^^ 2/1)3 so that its polar is 

yy^=-2a{x + x^) (1). 

Through T draw a straight line parallel to the axis ; its 
equation is therefore 

y=yi (2). 

Let this straight line meet the polar 
in V and the curve in P. 

The coordinates of F, which is the 
intersection of (1) and (2), are therefore 

^ —x^ and 2/1 (3). 

Also P is the point on the curve 
whose ordinate is y^, and whose coordi- 
nates are therefore 

2 
and 2/1.

Also the tangent at P is

is 



the 




yy,= 2a^.^f^ 

which is parallel to (1). 

Hence the polar of T is parallel 
to the tangent at P. 

To draw the polar of T we therefore draw a line through 
T, parallel to the axis, to meet the curve in P and produce 
it to Fso that TP-PV; a line through F parallel to the 
tangent at P is then the polar required. 

217. If the polar of a point P passes through the point T, then 
the polar of T goes through P. (Fig. Art. 214). 
Let P be the point (x^, y-^) and T the point {h, k). 
The polar of P is yy^ = 2a{x + x^). 
Since it passes through T, we have 

yj^k = 2a{x-^ + h) (1). 



PAIR OF TANGENTS FROM ANY POINT. 193 

The polar of T isyk = 2a (x+h). 

Since (1) is true, this equatio n is satisfied by the coordinates Xj^ 
and t/i- 

Hence the proposition. 

Cor. The point of intersection, T, of the polar s of two points, 
P and Q, is the pole of the line PQ. 

218. To find the pole of a given straight line ivith respect to the 
parabola. 

Let the given straight line be 

Ax + By+C=0. 
If its pole be the point {x^, y-^), it must be the same straight 
line as 

yy^ = 2a{x + x^), 

i.e. 2ax - yyi + 2axj^ = 0. 

Since these straight lines are the same, we have 
2a _ -yi _ 2axi 

G ^ 2Ba 

I.e. xi = j and y^= - -j- - 

219. To find the equation to the pcdr of tangents that 
can he drawn to the parabola from the point {x^^ y^. 

Let (A, k) be any point on either of the tangents drawn 
from (rL'i, y^. The equation to the line joining (x^, y^) to 
(^, k) is 

k— y. hy, - kx. 
%.e. y = - — -x^-^ \ 

If this be a tangent it must be of the form 

a 

y — mx -{ — , 

, , . k — y^ , hy. — kx. a 

so that . — ^ = m and ~- i = — . 

a — x^ h — x^ m 

Hence, by multiplication, 

k — y^ hy^ — kx^ 

i. e. a (lb - x^^ = {k — y^) [hy^ — kx^. 

I^ 13 



194 COOKDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The locus of the point (A, k) {i. e. the pair of tangents 
required) is therefore 

a(x-x^y = {y-y^) {xy^-yx:^ (1). 

It will be seen that this equation is the same as 
{f - \ax) (2/1^ - 4arci) = {2/2/1 - 2« (a? + x^f. 

220. To prove that the middle points of a system of 
parallel chords of a parabola all lie on a straight line which 
is parallel to the axis. 

Since the chords are all parallel, they all make the same 
angle with the axis of x. Let Q 

the tangent of this angle be on. 

The equation to QB, any- 
one of these chords, is there- y^^- 
fore 

y - mx + c (1 ), '^, 

where c is different for the 
several chords, but 7n is the 
same. 

This straight line meets the parabola y^ = 4:ax in points 
whose ordinates are given by 

m,y^ = 4:a (y — c), 

4:a Aac , . 

I.e. V y + =^0 (2). 

^ m ^ m • ' 

Let the roots of this equation, i.e. the ordinates of Q 
and Rj be y' and y'\ and let the coordinates of F, the 
middle point of QR, be (h, k). 

Then, by Art. 22, 

T _ y + y" _ 2« 

2 m 

from equation (2). 

The coordinates of V therefore satisfy the equation 

2a 

y=m^ 

so that the locus of F is a straight line parallel to the axis 
of the curve, 




MIDDLE POINTS OF PARALLEL CHORDS. 195 

2a 
The straight line 3/ = — meets the curve in a point P, 

whose ordinate is — and whose abscissa is therefore — x . 
m m" 

The tangent at this point is, by Art. 205, 

a 

y = Tnx -\ — , 

and is therefore parallel to each of the given chords. 

Hence the locus of the middle points of a system of 
parallel chords of a parabola is a straight line which is 
parallel to the axis and meets the curve at a point the 
tangent at which is parallel to the given system. 

221. To find the equation to the chord of the parabola ivhich is 
bisected at any point {h, Jc). 

By the last article the required chord is parallel to the tangent at 
the point P where a line through {h, k) parallel to the axis meets the 
curve. 

Also, by Art. 216, the polar of {h, k) is parallel to the tangent at 
this same point P. 

The required chord is therefore parallel to the polar yJc = 2a {x + h). 

Hence, since it goes through {h, k), its equation is 

k{y-k) = 2a{x- h) (Art. 67). 

222. Diameter. Def. The locus of the middle points 
of a system of parallel chords of a parabola is called a 
diameter and the chords are called its ordinates. 

Thus, in the figure of Art. 220, PF is a diameter and 
QB and all the parallel chords are ordinates to this 
diameter. 

The proposition of that article may therefore be stated 
as follows. 

Any diameter of a parabola is parallel to the axis and 
the tangent at the point where it Tneets the curve is parallel 
to its ordinates. 

223. The tangents at the ends of any chord meet on 
the diameter which bisects the chord. 

Let the equation of QR (Fig., Art. 220) be 

y = mx + c (1), 

13—2 



196 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



and let the tangents at Q and R meet at the point T 

Then QR is the chord of contact of tangents drawn 
from T^ and hence its equation is 

2/2/1 = 2a{x + x^) (Art. 213). 

Comparing this with equation (1), we have 

2a ,, , 2a 

— = m, so that Vi = — -&gt; 
2/1 ^* 

and therefore T lies on the straight line 

2a 

^ m 

But this straight line was proved, in Art. 220, to be 
the diameter P V which bisects the chord. 

224. To find the equation to a parabola, the axes 
being any diameter and the tangent to the parabola at the 
point where this diameter meets the curve. 

Let PVX be the diameter and PY the tangent at P 
meeting the axis in T. 

Take any point Q on the curve, 
and draw QM perpendicular to the 
axis meeting the diameter P F in L. 

Let PVhQ X and VQ be y. 
Draw PN perpendicular to the 
axis of the curve, and let 

e^ /. YPX=iPTM, 
Then 

iAS. A]S[^PN^ = ]SfT^ ts,Ti^e=^.AN^ . tan^ 6. 
:. ANr=:AS. cot^ e = a cot^ e, 
and PN = JIASTaN = 2a cot 6. 

Now QM'- = 4:AS.AM=4:a.AM (1). 

Also 
QM=JSrP + LQ = 2acote+ VQsmO = 2acotO+ysinO, 
and AM=A]\/' + PV+ VL=-acot^e + x + ycose. 




THE PARABOLA. EXAMPLES. 197 

Substituting these values in (1), we have 

(2a cot + y sin Oy — ia (a cot^ + x + y cos 6), 

i. e. if- sin^ 6 — ^ax. 

The required equation is therefore 

y'^^lpx (2), 

where 

p - T^= « (1 + ^ot' Q) = a^ AN= SP (by Art. 202). 

The equation to the parabola referred to the above axes 
is therefore of the same form as its equation referred to the 
rectangular axes of Art. 197. 

The equation (2) states that 

QV'^^iSP.PV. 

225. The quantity 4^j is called the parameter of the 
diameter P V. It is equal in length to the chord which is 
parallel to P F and passes through the focus. 

For if Q'V'R' be the chord, parallel to PZand passing 
through the focus and meeting PT in V\ we have 

PY' = ST=SP^p, 

so that Q' V"" ^ip.PV'^ ip\

7. Two equal parabolas with axes in opposite directions touch at 
a point O. From a point P on one of them are drawn tangents PQ 
and PQ' to the other. Prove that QQ' will touch the first parabola in 
■P' where PP' is parallel to the common tangent at O. 

Coordinates of any point on the parabola ex- 
pressed in terms of one variable. 

227. It is often convenient to express the coordinates 
of any point on the curve in terms of one variable. 

It is clear that the values 

a 2a 

mr 7n 

always satisfy the equation to the curve. 
Hence, for all values of m, the point 

a 2a\ 

lies on the curve. By Art. 206, this m is equal to the 
tangent of the angle v^hich the tangent at the point makes 
v^^ith the axis. 

The equation to the tangent at this point is 

a 

y = nix -\ — , 

and the normal is, by Art. 207, found to be 

a 

my + X = 2a + —-, . 
in- 



COORDINATES IN TERMS OF ONE VARIABLE. 199 

228. The coordinates of the point could also be ex- 
pressed in terms of the m of the normal at the point ; in 
this case its coordinates are am?' and — 2am, 

The equation of the tangent at the point (am^, — 2a7n) 
is, by Art. 205, 

mi/ + X + am^ — 0, 

and the equation to the normal is 

y — mx — 1am, — am?. 

229. The simplest substitution (avoiding both nega- 
tive signs and fractions) is 

X = at2 and y = 2at. 

These values satisfy the equation y^ = ^ax. 

The equations to the tangent and normal at the point 
{af, 2at) are, by Arts. 205 and 207, 

ty = x + at^, 

and y + tx= 2at + af. 

The equation to the straight line joining 

(atj^, 2at-^ and {at^, 2at^ 

is easily found to be 

y {h + ^2) = 2x + 2at-f^. 

The tangents at the points 

{at^^ 2at^ and iat^^ 2at^ 

are t-^y =^x-\- at^, 

and t.^y — x-\- at^. 

The point of -intersection of these two tangents is clearly 

{&lt;X^1^2} ^(^1 + ^2)}- 

The point whose coordinates are (a&lt;^, 2a£) may, for 
brevity, be called the point " tT 

In the following articles we shall prove some important 
properties of the parabola making use of the above substi- 
tution. 




200 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

230. If the tangents at P and Q meet in T, prove that 

(1) TP and TQ subtend equal angles at the focus Sy 

(2) ST^=SP.SQ, 
and (3) the triangles SPT and STQ are similar. 

Let P be the point {at^^, 2at^), and Q be the 

point (at^^, 2at2), so that (Art. 229) T is the point 

{atjt^, a(ii + t2)}- 

2at 
(1) The equation to SP is y= ^ ^ {x - a), 

i. e. [t-^ -l)y-2t-^x + 2at-^ = 0. 

The perpendicular, TU, from T on this 
straight line

^^(fi-io)- 
Similarly TC/' has the same numerical value. 
The angles PST and QST are therefore equal. 

(2) By Art. 202 we have SP=a{l + 1^^) and SQ = a(l + f.^). 
Also ST^ = (af 1^2 -a)^ + a^{t^ + t^y- 

= a^[tj;'t^^ + t^^ + t^^+l-\ = a^l + tj^){l + t^-^). 
Hence ST^ = SP.SQ. 

ST SO 

(3) Since — ^ = ^, and the angles TSP and T^SQ are equal, the 

oP ol 

triangles SPT and STQ are similar, so that 

Z /SQT^ z ^TP and Z ^rQ= z 5fPT. 

231. 27ze area of the triangle formed by three points on a 
parabola is twice the area of the triangle formed by the tangents at 
these points. 

Let the three points on the parabola be 

{at-^, 2at-^, [at^, 2at^, and {at^^, 2at^. 
The area of the triangle formed by these points, by Art. 25, 
= i [at-^ {2af2 - Saig) + at^ {2at^ - 2at-^) + at^ {2at-^ - 2at^)'\ 

The intersections of the tangents at these points are (Art. 229) 
the points 

{at^t.^, a[t^ + t^\, {at^t^, a{t^-\-tT^], and [at^t^, a{t^-\-t^]. 
The area of the triangle formed by these three points 

= \ {at^t^ {at^ - at^) + atj:-^ [at-^ - at^ + at-^t^ [at^-at^] 
=W{t^-ts){t^-t^){t^-t^). 
The first of these areas is double the second. 



MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES. 201 

232. The circle circumscribing the triangle formed by any three 
tangents to a parabola passes through the focus. 

Let P, Q, and R be the points at which the tangents are drawn 
and let their coordinates be 

{atj^, 2afj), (aig^ ^at^), and {at^^, 2at^). 
As in Art. 229, the tangents at Q and R intersect in the point 

{at^t^, a{t2 + t^)}. 
Similarly, the other pairs of tangents meet at the points 

{afgfi, ^(ig + ij)} and {at^t.^, a{tj^ + t2)}. 
Let the equation to the circle be 

x^ + y^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = (1). 

Since it passes through the above three points, we have 

a\%^ + a2 (&lt;2 + t.^)^ + 2gat^t^ + 2/a (f g + fg) + c = (2), 

aH^t^ + a2 {t^ + 1^'2 4- 2gat^t-^ + 2/a (tg + f^) + c = (3), 

and aH-^t^ + a^ («i + ^ ^ + 2gat-^t^ + 2fa{t^ + t^ + c = Q (4). 

Subtracting (3) from (2) and dividing by a {t^ - t^), we have 

a {fgS (fi + fa) + &lt;i + ^3 + 2*3} + 2gt^ + 2/= 0. 
Similarly, from (3) and (4), we have 

«{«i'(*2 + «3) + «2 + *3 + 2«i} + 25rfi + 2/=0. 
From these two equations we have 

2g=-a{l-\- t^ts + t^t-i + tjt^) and 2f== -alt-^ + t.^ + t^- t^t^ts]. 
Substituting these values in (2), we obtain 

c = a'^{t^ts + tstj^ + t-it2). 
The equation to the circle is therefore 
x^ + y^- ax (1 + £2*3 + *3^i + ^1^2) ~ ^^y ih + ^2 + ^3 ~ *i^2^3) 

+ a- (t^t^ + t^t^ + tj^t^) = 0, 
which clearly goes through the focus {a, 0). 

233. If be any point on the axis and POP' be any chord 
passing through 0, and if PM and P'M' be the ordinates of P and P', 
prove that AM . AM' = AO\ and PM . P'M'= - 4a . AO. 

Let O be the point {h, 0), and let P and P' be the points 

(afj2, 2atj) and {at^, 2at^. 
The equation to PP' is, by Art. 229, 

{t^ + t-^y -2x = 2at^t^. 
If this pass through the point [h, 0), we have 

-2h = 2at-^t^,

CHAPTER XL 



THE PARABOLA {continued). 



[On a first reading of this Chapter, the student may, with 
advantage, omit from Art. 239 to the end.] 

Some examples of Loci connected with the 
Parabola. 

235. Ex. 1. Find the locus of the intersection of tangents to the 
•parabola y^ = 4iax, the angle hetioeen them being always a given angle a. 

The straight line y ^mx -] — is always a tangent to the parabola. 

If it pass through the point T {h, h) we 
have 

m^h-mk + a = (1). 

If mj and Wg be the roots of this equation -»-

.-. k^-4:ah = {a + h)^t&amp;n^a. 

Hence the coordinates of the point T always satisfy the equation 

7/2 - 4kax = {a + x)^ tan^ a. 

We shall find in a later chapter that this curve is a hyperbola. 

As a particular case let the tangents intersect at right angles, so 
that m^^= - 1. 

From (3) we then have h= -a, so that in this case the point T lies 
on the straight line x= -a, which is the directrix. 

Hence the locus of the point of intersection of tangents, which cut 
at right angles, is the directrix. 

Ex. 2. Prove that the locus of the poles of chords which are normal 
to the parabola y^ = 4:ax is the curve 

2/2(a; + 2a) + 4a3 = 0. 

Let PQ be a chord which is normal at P. Its equation is then 

y = mx-2am-am^ (1). 

Let the tangents at P and Q. intersect in T, whose coordinates are 
h and k, so that we require the locus of T. 

Since PQ is the polar of the point {h, k) its equation is 

yk=2a{x + h) (2). 

Now the equations (1) and (2) represent the same straight line, so 
that they must be equivalent. Hence 

m = — , and - 2am - am^ = —j— . 

Eliminating m, i. e. substituting the value of m from the first of 
these equations in the second, we have 

4a2 8a^ _ 2ah 
~T~'W~~k'' 

i.e. ^ k^{h + 2a} + 4a^=0, 

The locus of the point T is therefore 

2/2(a; + 2a) + 4a3=0. 

Ex. 3. Find the locus of the middle points of chords of a parabola 
which subtend a right angle at the vertex, and prove that these chords all 
pass through a fixed point on the axis of the curve. 



208 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



First Method. Let PQ be any sucli chord, and let its equation be 
y = mx + c (1). 

The lines joining the vertex with the 
points of intersection of this straight line y 
with the parabola 

y^=^ax (2), 

are given by the equation A 

y^c = 4ax {y - mx). (Art. 122) 
These straight lines are at right angles if 
c + 4am=:0. (Art. Ill) 

Substituting this value of c in (1), the 
equation to FQ is 

y = m {x - 4a) 

This straight line cuts the axis of a; at a constant distance 4a from 
the vertex, i.e. AA' = 4a. 

If the middle point oi PQ be {h, k) we have, by Art. 220, 

2a 




(3). 



li=: 



(4). 
.(5). 



m 
Also the point {h, k) lies on (3), so that we have 

k = m{h-4a) 

If between (4) and (5) we eliminate m, we have 

kJ-^{h-4a), 

i.e. k^=1a{h-4ia), 

so that {h, k) always lies on the parabola 

2/2 = 2a (a; -4a). 

This is a parabola one half the size of the original, and whose 
vertex is at the point A' through which all the chords pass. 

Second Method. Let P be the point (afj^, 2at^ and Q be the point 
{at^, 2aio). 

The tangents of the inclinations of AP and AQ io the axis are 

— and — . 

1 2 

Since AP and AQ are at right angles, therefore 

*1 *2 



.(6). 



i.e. tih= -4 

As in Art. 229 the equation to PQ is 

{ty^ + t^y=:2x + 2at^t^ (7). 



THE PARABOLA. LOCI. 209 

This meets the axis of ic at a distance -atit2,i.e., by (6), 4a, from 
the origin. 

Also, {h, k) being the middle point of PQ, we have 

and 2k = 2a{tj^ + t2). 

Hence k- - 2ah = a^ (f^ + 1^)^ - a^ {tj^ + 1^^) 

= 2a\t2= -8a2, 
so that the locus of (h, k) is, as before, the parabola 

y^ — 2a{x- 4a). 

Tbird Method. The equation to the chord which is bisected at 
the point {h, k) is, by Art. 221, 

k{y-k) = 2a{x-h), 
i. e. ky - 2ax=k^ - 2ah (8). 

As in Art. 122 the equation to the straight lines joining its points 
of intersection with the parabola to the vertex is 

{k^ - 2ah) 2/2 = iax {ky - 2ax). 
These lines are at right angles if 

{k^-2ah) + 8a^ = 0. 
Hence the locus as before. 

Also the equation (8) becomes 

ky - 2ax = - 8a^. 
This straight line always goes through the point (4a, 0).

25. Through each point of the straight line x = niy + h is drawn 
the chord of the parabola y^=4iax which is bisected at the point; 
prove that it always touches the parahola 

{y - 2am)^=8d {x - h). 

26. Two parabolas have the same axis and tangents are drawn to 
the second from points on the first ; prove that the locus of the middle 
points of the chords of contact with the second parabola all lie on a 
fixed parabola. 

27. Prove that the locus of the feet of the perpendiculars drawn 
from the vertex of the parabola upon chords, which subtend an angle 
of 45° at the vertex, is the curve 

r2 - 24ar cos 6 + 16a^ cos 29 = 0. 



236. To prove that, in general, three normals can be 
drawn from any point to the parahola and that the algebraic 
sum, of the ordinates of the feet of these three normals is 
zero. 



The straight line 

y — mx — 2am — amP 

is, by Art. 208, a normal to the 
parabola at the points whose coordi- 
nates are 

arn^ and — 2am (2). 

If this normal passes through 
the fixed point 0, vi^hose coordinates 
are h and k, we have

212 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

This equation, being of the third degree, has three 
roots, real or imaginary. Corresponding to each of these 
roots, we have, on substitution in (1), the equation to a 
normal which passes through the point 0. 

Hence three normals, real or imaginary, pass through 
any point 0. 

If m^, iiu, and m^ be the roots of the equation (3), we 
have 

m^ + m.^ + m^ = 0. 

If the ordinates of the feet of these normals be 2/^, y^, 
and 2/3, we then have, by (2), 

2/1 + 2/2 + 2/3 = - 2o^ {m^ + ^2 + m^) = 0. 

Hence the second part of the proposition. 

We shall find, in a subsequent chapter, that, for certain 
positions of the point 0, all three normals are real ; for 
other positions of 0, one normal only will be real, and the 
other two imaginary. 

237. Ex. Find the locus of a point which is such that (a) two of 
the normals drawn from it to the parabola are at right angles, 
(j8) the three normals through it cut the axis in points whose distances 
from, the vertex are in arithjnetical progression. 

Any normal is y=mx-2am-am^, and this passes through the 
point {h, k), if 

am^ + {2a-h)m+k = (1). 

If then nil , m^, and m^ be the roots, we have, by Art. 2, 

m-y + m^ + m^ = , (2) , 

m^m^ + m^mi + mim^= , (3), 

k 
and mim2m^= — (4). 

(a) If two of the normals, say m^ and m^^ , be at right angles, we 

k 
have wiim2=-l, and hence, from (4), m^—-. 

k 
The quantity - is therefore a root of (1) and hence, by substitution, 

Of 

we have 

-+{2a-h)~ + k = 0, 
a^ ^ a 

i.e. k^=a{h-3a). 



THREE NORMALS. EXAMPLES. 213 

The locus of the point (/^, k) is therefore the parabola y'^ = a{x- 3a) 
whose vertex is the point (3a, 0) and whose latus rectum is one-quarter 
that of the given parabola. 

The student should draw the figure of both parabolas. 

(/3) The normal y = mx - 2am - am^ meets the axis of a; at a point 
whose distance from the vertex is 2a + aw^. The conditions of the 
question then give 

(2a + awij^) + (2a + am^^) = 2 (2a + am^^) , 

i.e. m-^ + m.^ = 2m&lt;^ (5). 

If we eliminate m^, m^, and m^ from the equations (2), (3), (4), 
and (5) we shall have a relation between h and k. 
From (2) and (3), we have 

= vi^m.^ + m^ (wii + m^) = m^m^ - m^^ (6). 

Also, (5) and (2) give 

2m2^ = {v\ + wig)^ - Im^m.^ — m.^ - Im-^^ , 

i.e. m^ + 2m^m^ =0 (7). 

Solving (6) and (7), we have 

2a - 7t , „ ^ 2a-h 

vi.mo= —z — , and ot^-^ - 2 x —r — .

Substituting these values in (4), we have

i.e. 27afc2 = 2(7i-2a)3, 

so that the required locus is 

27ai/2=2(a;-2a)3. 

238. Ex. If the normals at three points P, Q, and R meet in a 
point and S be the focus, prove that SP . SQ . SR = a . S0\ 

As in the previous question we know that the normals at the 
points (ayn-^^, -2amj), {ain.^,-2am2^ and {am.^,-2am^) meet in the 
point (A, k) if 

mj + ^2 + m3 = (1),

20. If the normals drawn from any point to the parabola cut the

239. In Art. 197 we obtained the simplest possible 
form of the equation to a parabola. 

We shall now transform the origin and axes in the 
most general manner. 

Let the new origin have as coordinates [h, k), and let 
the new axis of x be inclined at to the original axis, and 
let the new angle between the axes be o&gt;'. 



PAEABOLA. TWO TANGENTS AS AXES. 217 

By Art. 133 we have for x and y to substitute 

X cos B -^y cos (w' + ^) + A, 

and X sin Q + y sin (to' + ^) + ^ 

respectively. 

The equation of Art. 197 then becomes 

{x sin B-\-y sin (o&gt;' + ^) + ^|^ = 4a {x cos ^ + y cos (w' + 6^) + A}, 
i.e. 
\x sin ^ + 2/ sin (&lt;o' + ^)}^ + 2£c {A; sin ^ - 2a cos ^} 

+ 1y {h sin (w' + ^) - 2a cos (w' + ^)} + ^^^ _ 4^;^ ^ q 

■••••••(l)- 

This equation is therefore the most general form of the 
equation to a parabola. 

We notice that in it the terms of the second degree 
always form a perfect square. 

240. To find the equation to a 'parabola, any two 
tangents to it being the axes of coordinates and the points of 
contact being distant a and b from the origin. 

By the last article the most general form of the equa- 
tion to any parabola is 

{Ax-^Byf-v2gx+2fy-^c = (1). 

This meets the axis of x in points whose abscissae are 
given by 

^ V + ^gx + c = (2). 

If the parabola touch the axis of x at a distance a from 
the origin, this equation must be equivalent to 

A^{x-af = (3). 

Comparing equations (2) and (3), we have 

g- — A^a, and c = A^a^ (4). 

Similarly, since the parabola is to touch the axis of y 
at a distance b from the origin, we have 

f=-B%, and c=^B''b' (5). 



218 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

From (4) and (5), equating the values of c, we have 

sothat B = ±A^ (6). 

Taking the negative sign, we have 

B = -A'^, g = -'A\ f^-A'j, and G=A'a\ 

Substituting these values in (1) we have, as the required 
equation,

[The radical signs in (8) can clearly have both the positive and 
negative signs prefixed. The different equations thus obtained corre- 
spond to different portions of the curve. In the figure of Art. 243, 
the abscissa of any point on the portion PAQ is &lt;a, and the ordinate 
&lt; h, so that for this portion of the curve we must take both signs 

positive. For the part beyond P the abscissa is &gt; a, and - &gt; r , so 

that the signs must be + and - . For the part beyond Q the 

fit n^ 

ordinate is &gt;&amp;, and v&gt;-, so that the signs must be - and +.

There is clearly no part of the cui-ve corresponding to two negative 
signs.] 



PARABOLA. TWO TANGENTS AS AXES. 219 

241. If in the previous article we took the positive 
sign in (6), the equation would reduce to 



(- + I-) _2--^ + l = 0, 
\a J a 



This gives us (Fig., Art. 243) the pair of coincident 
straight lines PQ. This pair of coincident straight lines is 
also a conic meeting the axes in two coincident points at P 
and Q, but is not the parabola required. 

242. To find the equation to the tangent at any point 
(x', y') of the parabola 

Let (cc", 2/") be any point on the curve close to {x ^ y). 
The equation to the line joining these two points is 

y - 2/' = |iJ~' («-«') (1)- 

But, since these points lie on the curve, we have

so that ^gz^ = -^ (3).

This is the required equation. 

[In the foregoing we have assumed that [x', y') Hes on the portion 
PAQ (Fig., Art. 243). If it lie on either of the other portions the 
proper signs must be affixed to the radicals, as in Art. 240.]

the point of contact of the given line is ( "— , ^ J .

243. To find the focus of the j^arabola 



a W h 

Let ^S' be the focus, the origin, and P and Q the 
points of contact of the parabola with the axes. 

Since, by Art. 230, the triangles OSP and QSO are 
similar, the angle SOP- angle SQO. 

Hence if we describe a circle through 0, Q, and S, then, 
by Euc. III. 32, OP is the tangent to it at P. 



PARABOLA. TWO TANGENTS AS AXES. 221 

Hence S lies on the circle passing through the origin 
0, the point Q, (0, b), and touching the axis of x at the 
origin.

The equation to this circle is 

x^ + 2xy cos oi +y^ = by ( 1 ). 

Similarly, since z SOQ — L SPO^ S will lie on the circle 
through and P and touching the axis of y at the origin, 
i.e. on the circle 

x^ + 2xy cos (0 +y'^ — ax (2). 

The intersections of (1) and (2) give the point required. 
On solving (1) and (2), we have as the focus the point

244. To find the equation to the axis. 

If V be the middle point of PQ^ we know, by Art. 223, 
that F is parallel to the axis. 

Now V is the point ( - , - ) . 

Hence the equation to F is y = -x. 

The equation to the axis (a line through S parallel to 
F) is therefore

245 . To find the equation to the directrix. 

If we find the point of intersection of OP and a 
tangent perpendicular to OP, this point will (Art. 211, y) 
be on the directrix. 

Similarly we can obtain the point on OQ which is on 
the directrix. 

A straight line through the point (/, 0) perpendicular 
to OX is 

y = in{x —f), where (Art. 93) 1 +7n cos o&gt; = 0. 

The equation to this perpendicular straight line is 
then 

x+ 2/ cos (0 =y (1). 

This straight line touches the parabola if (Art. 242)

To find the equation to an ellipse. 

Let ZK be the directrix, S the focus, and let SZ be 
perpendicular to the directrix. 




There will be a point A on SZ, such that 

SA = e.AZ (1). 

Since e &lt; 1, there will be another point A\ on ZS produced, 
such that 

SA' = e.A'Z (2).

Let the length A A! be called 2&lt;a^, and let C be the middle

'la=-AA! = e{AZ^A:Z) = 'l.e.CZ, 

i.e. CZ = - (3). 

Subtracting (1) from (2), we have 

e{A:Z-AZ)^SA'-8A^{SG^CA')-{GA-CS), 

i.e. e.AA' = 2CS, 

and hence CS — a.e (4). 

Let G be the origin, CA' the axis of x, and a line through

Let P be any point on the curve, whose coordinates are

The focus S is the point (— ae, 0). 

The relation SP" = e^ . PM^ = e" . ZN^ then gives

If in this equation we put x = Oy we have

B and B', lying on opposite sides of C, such that

Def. The points A and A' are called the vertices of 
the curve, AA' is called the major axis, and BB' the minor 
axis. Also C is called the centre. 

249. Since ♦S' is the point {—ae, 0), the equation to 
the ellipse referred to S as origin is (Art. 128), 

The equation referred to A as origin, and AX and a 
perpendicular line as axes, is

The equation to the ellipse, whose focus and directrix are any 
given point and line, and whose eccentricity is known, is easily 
written down. 

For example, if the focus be the point (-2, 3), the directrix be 
the line 2a; + 3?/ + 4 = 0, and the eccentricity be |, the required equa- 
tion is 

i.e. 261*2 + 181i/2 - 192a;?/ + 1044a; - 2334?/ + 3969 = 0.

228 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Generally, the equation to the ellipse, whose focus is the point 
(/&gt; P)&gt; whose directrix is Ax + By + C = 0, and whose eccentricity 
is e, is 

250. There exist a second focus and a second directrix 
for the curve. 

On the positive side of the origin take a point S', which 
is such that SO — CS' = ae, and another point Z', such that 

e 

Draw Z'K' perpendicular to ZZ\ and PM' perpen- 
dicular to Z'K'. 

The equation (5) of Art. 247 may be written in the 
form 

x^ — 2aex + ah^ + y^ = ^'^^ - 2aeaj + c?, 

i.e. {x - aef -^ y^ = e^ (- - x\ , 

i.e. ST^^e^PM"". 

Hence any point P of the curve is such that its distance 
from S' is e times its distance from Z'K', so that we should 
have obtained the same curve, if we had started with S' as 
focus, Z'K' as directrix, and the same eccentricity. 

251. The sum of the focal distances of any point on the 
curve is equal to the major axis. 
For (Fig. Art. 247) we have 

SP = e.PM, and S'P^e.PM'. 
Hence 

SP + S'P = e (PM+PM') = e . MM'

252. Mechanical construction for an ellipse. 

By the preceding article we can get a simple mechanical 
method of constructing an ellipse. 

Take a piece of thread, whose length is the major axis 
of the required ellipse, and fasten its ends at the points S 
and aS" which are to be the foci. 

Let the point of a pencil move on the paper, the point 
being always in contact with the string and keeping the 
two portions of the string between it and the fixed ends 
always tight. If the end of the pencil be moved about on 
the paper, so as to satisfy these conditions, it will trace out 
the curve on the paper. For the end of the pencil will be 
always in such a position that the sum of its distances from 
S and S' will be constant. 

In practice, it is easier to fasten two drawing pins at S 
and aS", and to have an endless piece of string whose total 
length is equal to the sum of SS' and AA'. This string 
must be passed round the two pins at S and aS" and then be 
kept stretched by the pencil as before. By this second 
arrangement it will be found that the portions of the curve 
near A and A' can be more easily described than in the first 
method. 

253. Latus-rectum of the ellipse. 

Let LSL' be the double ordinate of the curve which 
passes through the focus aS'. By the definition of the curve, 
the semi-latus-rectum SL 

= e times the distance of L from the directrix 

^e.SZ=e{CZ-CS) = e.CZ-e.CS 

= a — ae^ (by equations (3) and (4) of Art. 247) 

= -. (Art. 247.)

or X 

From (2), it follows that if Q^&gt;a?, i.e. if x&gt; a ov &lt;- a^ 
then y is impossible. There is therefore no part of the 
curve to the right of J.' or to the left of A. 

From (3), it follows, similarly, that, if y&gt;h or &lt;:-6, 
X is impossible, and hence that there is no part of the curve 
above B or below B'. 

If X lie between — a and + a^ the equation (2) gives two 
equal and opposite values for y^ so that the curve is sym- 
metrical with respect to the axis of x. 

If y lie between — h and + 5, the equation (3) gives two 
equal and opposite values for x^ so that the curve is sym- 
metrical with respect to the axis of y. 

If a number of values in succession be given to £c, and 
the corresponding values of y be determined, we shall 
obtain a series of points which will all be found to lie on a 
curve of the shape given in the figure of Art. 247.

centre drawn in a given direction. 

The equation (6) of Art. 247 when transferred to polar 
coordinates becomes 

r^cos^^ r^sin^^ 

a'W 

We thus have the value of the radius vector drawn at any 
inclination 6 to the axis. 

Since r^ = ^a — r-s — tit^ — r-„-;, , we see that the greatest 
62 + (a2-62)sin2(9' *= 

value of r is when ^ = 0, and then it is equal to a. 

Similarly, B == 90° gives the least value of r, viz. h. 

Also, for each value of ^, we have two equal and opposite 
values of r, so that any line through the centre meets the 
curve in two points equidistant from it. 

257. Auxiliary circle. Def. The circle which is 
described on the major axis, AA\ of an ellipse as diameter, 
is called the auxiliary circle of the ellipse. 

Let NP be any ordinate of the ellipse, and let it be 
produced to meet the auxiliary circle in Q. 

Since the angle AQA' is a right angle, being the angle 
in a semicircle, we have, by Euc. vi. 8, QN^ = AN. NA'.

The point Q in which the ordinate NF meets the 
auxiliary circle is called the corresponding point to P. 

The ordinates of any point on the ellipse and the 
corresponding point on the auxiliary circle are therefore to 
one another in the ratio h : «, i.e. in the ratio of the 
semi-minor to the semi-major axis of the ellipse. 

The ellipse might therefore have been defined as follows : 

Take a circle and from each point of it draw perpen- 
diculars upon a diameter ; the locus of the points dividing 
these perpendiculars in a given ratio is an ellipse, of which 
the given circle is the auxiliary circle. 

258. Eccentric Angle. Def. The eccentric angle 
of any point F on the ellipse is the angle NCQ made with 
the major axis by the straight line CQ joining the centre G 
to the point Q on the auxiliary circle which corresponds to 
the point P. 

This angle is generally called ^. 



THE ECCENTRIC ANGLE. 233 

We have CJV=CQ . cos, &lt;f&gt; = a cos (f&gt;, 

and J^Q = CQ sin (f&gt; = a sin &lt;^. 

Hence, by the last article, 

a 

The coordinates of any point P on the ellipse are there- 
fore a cos &lt;f&gt; and b sin ^. 

Since F is known when ^ is given, it is often called 
" the point &lt;^." 

259. To obtain the equation of the straight line joi^iing 
two points on the ellij^se whose eccentric angles are given. 

Let the eccentric angles of the two points, P and P\ be 
ff&gt; and ^', so that the points have as coordinates 

{a cos ^, b sin ^) and (a cos &lt;^', 6 sin ^f)'). 

The equation of the straight line joining them is

This is the required equation. 

Cor. The points on the auxiliary circle, corresponding to P and 
P', have as coordinates (a cos 0, a sin 0) and (a cos 0', a sin 0')- 

The equation to the line joining them is therefore (Art. 178)

This straight line and (1) clearly make the same intercept on the 
major axis. 

Hence the straight line joining any two points on an ellipse, and 
the straight line joining the corresponding points on the auxiliary 
circle, meet the major axis in the same point.

260. Tojind the intersections of any straight li7ie with 
the ellipse 

T + |I=1 (1). 

Let the equation of the straight line be 

y ^ TThx + c (2). 

The coordinates of the points of intersection of (1) and 
(2) satisfy both equations and are therefore obtained by 
solving them as simultaneous equations. 

Substituting for y in (1) from (2), the abscissae of the 
points of intersection are given by the equation 

^ (mx + cf 

a' '^ ^ir~ " ' 

i.e. x" {a^mP + b') + 2a^mcx + a' (c" - If) = (3). 

This is a quadratic equation and hence has two roots, 
realj coincident, or imaginary. 

Also corresponding to each value of x we have from (2) 
one value of y. 

The straight line therefore meets the curve in two points 
real, coincident, or imaginary. 

The roots of the equation (3) are real, coincident, or 
imaginary according as 

(2a^?7ic)^— 4 (b^+a^ni^) x a^ (d^—lr) is positive, zero, or negative, 

i.e. according as h^(h'^-\-a^m?)—l?c^ is positive, zero, or negative, 

i.e. according as c^ is &lt; =: or &gt; ahn^ + h^.

Let P and Q be two points on the ellipse, whose coordi- 
nates are {x\ y') and {x", y"). 

The equation to the straight line PQ is

Since both P and Q lie on the ellipse, we have

tained from the equation to the curve by the rule of 
Art. 152. 

263. To find the equation to a tangent in terms of the 
tcmgent of its inclination to the major axis. 

As in Art. 260, the straight line 

y = 7nx + c (1) 

meets the ellipse in points whose abscissae are given by 

af (62 + ahn") + Imca'x + a" (c^ - h'') = 0, 

and, by the same article, the roots of this equation are 
coincident if 

c = \ja?m^ + y^. 

In this case the straight line (1) is a tangent, and 
it becomes 

y = mx+ Va2m2 + b2 (2). 

This is the required equation. 

Since the radical sign on the right-hand of (2) may 
have either + or — prefixed to it, we see that there are two 
tangents to the ellipse having the same w^, i.e. there are 
two tangents parallel to any given direction. 

The above form of the equation to the tangent may be deduced 
from the equation of Art. 262, as in the ease of the parabola 
(Art. 206). It will be found that the point of contact is the point 

/ - c?'m y^ \ 



EQUATION TO THE TANGENT. 239 

264. By a proof similar to that of the last article, it 
may be shewn that the straight line 

X cos a + y sin a =^p 

touches the ellipse, if 

p2 = a2 cos2 a + b2 sin2 a. 

Similarly, it may be shewn that the straight line 
Ix + my = n 
touches the ellipse, if aH^ + b^m^ = v?. 

265. Equation to the tangent at the point whose 
eccentric angle is &lt;f&gt;. 

The coordinates of the point are (a cos ^, b sin (ft). 

Substituting x' = a cos &lt;^ and y' — b sin &lt;f&gt; in the equation 
of Art. 262, we have, as the required equation, 

X V 

- COS ^ + ^ sin ^ = 1 (1).

This equation may also be deduced from Art. 259. 

For the equation of the tangent at the point "&lt;^" is 
obtained by making cf&gt;' = (ft in the result of that article. 

Ex. Find the intersection of the tangents at the points &lt;p and &lt;p'. 
The equations to the tangents are

The required normal is the straight line which passes 
through the point {x\ y) and is perpendicular to the 
tangent, i.e. to the straight line

Its equation is therefore 

y — y' —m(x — x')^ 

where m ( — ^-\ = -l, i.e. m ^ ^, , (Art. 69).

270. Some properties of the ellipse. 

(a) SG = e,SP, and the tangent and normal at P bisect the 
external and internal angles between the focal distances of P. 

By Art. 269, we have CG=e^x'. 



SOME PROPERTIES OF THE ELLIPSE. 243 

Hence SG = SC+CG = ae + e^x' = e.SP, by Art. 251. 

Also S'G=zCS'-CG = e{a-ex') = e.S'P. 

Hence SG : S'G :: SP : S'P. 

Therefore, by Euc. vi, 3, PG bisects the angle SPS'. 

It follows that the tangent bisects the exterior angle between 
SP and ST. 

(/3) If SY and S'Y' be the perpendiculars from the foci upon the 
tangent at any point P of the ellipse, then Y and Y' lie on the auxiliary 
circle, and SY . S'Y' = b'^. Also GY and S'P are parallel. 

The equation to any tangent is 

X co^a + y Bva.a=p (1), 



where p = sja^ cos^ a + 6^ gin^ a (Art. 264). 

The perpendicular SY to (1) passes through the point {-ae, 0) 
and its equation, by Art. 70, is therefore 

(a; + ae)sin a- j/cos a = (2). 

If Y be the point {h, k) then, since Y lies on both (1) and (2), we 
have 

h cos a + k sin a — sja^ cos^ a + b^ sin^ a, 

and h sin a - ^ cos a= -ae sin a = - ija^ - b^ sin^ a. 

Squaring and adding these equations, we have h'^ + k'^ = a'^, so that 
Y lies on the auxihary circle x^ + y'^:= c^. 

Similarly it may be proved that Y' lies on this circle. 
Again S is the point ( - ae, 0) and S' is (ae, 0). 
Hence, from (1), 

SY=p-\-ae cos a, and S'Y'=p - ae cos a. (Art. 75.) 
Thus SY . S'Y' =^2 _ a2g2 cos2 a 

= a^ cos^ a + &amp;2 sin^ a-{a'^- b^) cos^ a

272. To prove that through any given point (cci, 3/1) 
there pass, in general, two tangents to an ellipse. 

The equation to any tangent is (by Art. 263) 

y = mx + sja^m^ + b^ (1). 

If this pass through the fixed point (x-^^, y-^, we have 
2/1 — mcci = sjo^m? + IP-, 
i.e. y^ — Imx-^y^ + w^x^ — c^w? + IP", 
i.e. m^{x^-a^)-'imXjy^+{y{--¥)^Q (2). 

For any given values of x^ and y^ this equation is in 
general a quadratic equation and gives two values of m 
(real or imaginary). 

Corresponding to each value of m we have, by sub- 
stituting in (1), a different tangent. 

The roots of (2) are real and different, if 

(- 2x^y^y - 4 (a?!^ — a^) {y^ - If) be positive, 

i. e. if IPx^ + a^y^ — a^lP be positive, 

X " 11 
i.e. ii ^ + ^ - 1 be positive, 

a^ 0^ 

i.e. if the point {x^, y-^ be outside the curve. 

The roots are equal, if 

h-x^^ + a'^y^^ - a-62 

be zero, i.e. if the point {x^, y-^ lie on the curve. 



CHORD OF CONTACT OF TANGENTS. 249 

The roots are imaginary, if 

be negative, i.e. if the point (a?i, y^ lie within the curve 
(Art. 255). 

273. Equation to the chord of contact of tangents 
drawn from a point {x^, y-^). 

The equation to the tangent at any point Q, whose 
coordinates are x and y', is 

^ + ^' =, 1 

Also the tangent at the point R, whose coordinates are 
x" and y\ is

If these tangents meet at the point 57, whose coordi-

a^ 0^ ^ ^ 

The equation to ^^ is then 

^^^=^ (3)- 

For, since (1) is true, the point {x, y') lies on (3). 

Also, since (2) is true, the point {x'\ y") lies on (3). 

Hence (3) must be the equation to the straight line 
joining (x', y) and {x\ y"), i.e. it must be the equation to 
QR the required chord of contact of tangents from {x^, v/i)-

250 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Let Q and M be the points in which any chord drawn 
through the point (ccj, y-^ meets the ellipse [Fig. Art. 214]. 

Let the tangents at Q and R meet in the point whose 
coordinates are (A, h). 

"We require the locus of {Ji, k). 

Since QR is the chord of contact of tangents from 
(A, ^), its equation (Art. 273) is 

xh yk 
~^'^'¥^ 

Since this straight line passes through the point (x^, ^j), 
we have

Since the relation (1) is true, it follows that the point 
(A, k) lies on the straight line 

^^W=^ (^)- 

Hence (2) is the equation to the polar of the point 

Cor. The polar of the focus (ae, o) is

i.e. the corresponding directrix. 

275. "When the point (iCj, y^ lies outside the ellipse, 
the equation to its polar is the same as the equation of the 
chord of contact of tangents from it. 

When (a^i, y^ is on the ellipse, its polar is the same as 
the tangent at it. 

As in Art. 215 the polar of (x^^ y^ might have been 
defined as the chord of contact of the tangents, real or 
imaginary, drawn from it. 

276. By a proof similar to that of Art. 217 it can be 
shewn that If the polar of P pass through T, then the polar 
of T passes through P.

277. To find the coordinates of the pole of any given

Let (x^, 2/i) be its pole. Then (1) must be the same as

Comparing (1) and (2), as in Art. 218, the required pole 
is easily seen to be 

278. To find the equation to the pair of tangents that 
can be drawn to the ellipse from the point (x^^j y^. 

Let (h, k) be any point on either of the tangents that 
can be drawn to the ellipse. 

The equation of the straight line joining (A, k) to 
(fljj, 2/i) is 

^ - Vl / x 

k — y^ hy. — kx. 
t.e. y = j — ^x+^ ^\ 

If this straight line touch the ellipse, it must be of the 
form 

y = mx + s]a^w? + h^. ( Art. 263.) 
Hence 

rnJ^, and f^^lJl^V = „W + Jl 
h — x^ \ h — x^ J 

Hence f ^^' " ^■ Y = «^ faV + 6'.

But this is the condition that the point (A, U) may lie 
on the locus 

{xy^ - x^yf =a'{y- y^f + b''{x- x^f (1). 

This equation is therefore the equation to the required 
tangents.

279. To Jind the locus of the middle points of parallel

Let the chords make with the axis an angle whose

where c is different for the different chords.

Let the roots of this equation, i.e. the abscissae of Q

the point [h, k).

Also V lies on the straight line (1), so that

If between (3) and (4) we eliminate c, we have

^" a?rri' + }f ' 

i. e. hVi = ~ a^mk (5). 

Hence the point (A, k) always lies on the straight line

The required locus is therefore the straight line 

y — 7n-,x, where m, = ^r— ,

I.e. mm. — -„ (7). 

280. Equation to the chord ivhose middle point is {h, k). 
The required equation is (1) of the foregoing article, where m and 
c are given by equations (4) and (5), so that 

b^h , a?k^ + y-h'^ 
m=-^.andc = __^-. 

The required equation is therefore 

^~ a'k''^ a?k ' 

i.e. ^^{y-Jc)+~{X-h)=0. 

It is therefore parallel to the polar of {h, k). 

281. Diameter. Def. The locus of the middle 
points of parallel chords of an ellipse is called a diameter, 
and the chords are called its double ordinates. 

By equation (6) of Art. 279 we see that any diameter 
passes through the centre C. 

Also, by equation (7), we see that the diameter 7/ — m^x 
bisects all chords parallel to the diameter y — mx, if

But the symmetry of the result (1) shows that, in this 
case, the diameter y — rax bisects all chords parallel to the 
diameter y — m^x. 

Such a pair of diameters are called Conjugate Diameters. 
Hence 

Conjugate Diameters. Def. Two diameters are 
said to be conjugate when each bisects all chords parallel 
to the other. 

Two diameters y — tnx and y — m^x are therefore con- 
jugate, if 

miXli = — — g- ,

282. The tangent at the extremity of any diameter is 
parallel to the chords which it bisects. 

In the Figure of Art. 279 let [x, y') be the point P on 
the ellipse, the tangent at which is parallel to the chord 
QBj whose equation is 

y — inx + c (1). 

The tangent at the point (a;', y) is 

^' + ^'=1 (2). 

a-' o" ^ ' 

Since (1) and (2) are parallel, we have 

a-'y 
i.e. the point (cc', y^ lies on the straight line 

a^m, 

But, by Art. 279, this is the diameter which bisects QR 
and all chords which are parallel to it. 

Cor. It follows that two conjugate diameters CP and 
CD are such that each is parallel to the tangent at the 
extremity of the other. Hence, given either of these, we 
have a geometrical construction for the other. 



CONJUGATE DIAMETERS. 255 

283. The tangents at the ends of any chord meet on the 
diameter which bisects the chord. 

Let the equation to the chord QR (Art. 279) be 

2/ = ma;+ c (1). 

Let T be the point of intersection of the tangents at Q 
and Rj and let its coordinates be x^ and y^. 

Since QR is the chord of contact of tangents from T^ its 
equation is, by Art. 273, 

^V^^l (2) 

The equations (1) and (2) therefore represent the same 
straight line, so that

i.e. {h^ k) lies on the straight line 

am, 
which, by Art. 279, is the equation to the diameter bisect- 
ing the chord QR. Hence T lies on the straight line GP. 

284. If the eccentric angles of the ends, P and D, of a 
pair of conjugate diameters he &lt;^ and (f&gt;', then &lt;^ and cf&gt;' differ 
by a right angle. 

Since P is the point [a cos ^, h sin &lt;/&gt;), the equation to

Cor. 1. The points on the auxiliary circle correspond-

For if p and d be these points then, by Art. 258, we 
have 

z.79(7^'-&lt;^ and LdCA'^^'. 
Hence 

LpGd=^ LdCA' - LpGA' = &lt;f&gt;-&lt;j&gt;' = 90\ 

Cor. 2. In the figure of Art. 286 if P be the point &lt;fi, 
then D is the point ^ + 90° and D' is the point &lt;^ - 90°. 

285. From the previous article it follows that if P be 
the point {a cos c(&gt;, b sin &lt;^), then D is the point 

{a cos (90° + &lt;^), b sin (90° + &lt;^)} i- e. (— a sin &lt;^, b cos &lt;/&gt;).

286. If PCP' and BCD' be a pair of conjugate dia- 
meierSj then (1) CP^ + CD^ is constant, and (2) the area of 
the parallelogram formed by the tangents at the ends of these 
diameters is constant. 




CONJUGATE DIAMETERS. 257 

Let P be the point ^, so that its coordinates are a cos ^ 
and h sin &lt;^. Then D is the point 90° + &lt;/&gt;, so that its co- 
ordinates are 

a cos (90° + ^) and h sin (90°+ &lt;^), 
i.e. —a sin ^ and h cos &lt;^. 

(1) We therefore have 

CP^ = «' cos^ &lt;^ + 6' sin^ &lt;^, 
and CD'^ - a? sin^ cj&gt; + b"^ cos^ ^, 

Hence CP^ + CB' = 0"+ b'^ 

— the sum of the squares of the semi-axes of the ellipse. 

(2) Let KLMN be the parallelogram formed by the 
tangents at P, D, P', and D'. 

By Euc. I. 36j we have 

area KLMN = 4 . area CPXD 

-4. GU.PK=iCU.CD, 
where CU is the perpendicular from C upon the tangent 
at P. 

Now the equation to the tangent at P is 

- cos &lt;l&gt; + T sin (i) — 1 = 0,

so that (Art. 75) we have

Hence CU.CI) = ab. 

Thus the area of the parallelogram KLMN = iab, 

which is equal to the rectangle formed by the tangents 
at the ends of the major and minor axes. 

287. The product of the focal distances of a point P is 
equal to the square on the semidiameter parallel to the tangent 
at P. 

If P be the point (p, then, by Art. 251, we have

the locus of 

(1) the middle point of PD, 

(2) the intersection of the tangents at P and D, 

and (3) the foot of the perpendicular from the centre upon PD. 
P is the point (a cos 0, h sin 0) and D is ( - a sin 0, 6 cos 0). 

(1) If (x, y) be the middle point of PD, we have 

a cos d&gt;-a sin d) ^ h sin + &amp; cos

If we eliminate we shall get the required locus. We obtain

The locus is therefore a concentric and similar ellipse. 
[N.B. Two ellipses are similar if the ratios of their axes are the 
same, so that they have the same eccentricity.] 

(2) The tangents are 

-cos0 + vsin0=l, 
a b 

and -- sin0 + rcos0 = l. 

a b ^ 

Both of these equations hold at the intersection of the tangents. 
If we eliminate we shall have the equation of the locus of their 
intersections. 

By squaring and adding, we have 

so that the locus is another similar and concentric ellipse. 

(3) By Art. 259, on putting 0' = 9O° + 0, the equation to PD is 

- cos (45° + 0) + 1 sin (45° + 0) = cos 45°. 

Let the length of the perpendicular from the centre be 2^ and let it 
make an angle w with the axis. Then this line must be equivalent to 

xcosu + ysm(a=p.

Comparing the equations, we have 

..^r. X a cos CO cos 45° , . , , _„ , . &amp; sin w cos 45° 
cos (45° + ^) = , and sin(4o° + &lt;^) = 



Hence, by squaring and adding, 2p2=a2cos2 w + ft^sin^w, i.e. the 
locus required is the curve 

289. Equiconjugate diameters. Let P and D be ex- 
tremities of equiconjugate diameters, so that CP^ = CDK 

If the eccentric angle of P be 0, we then have 
a^ cos^ (f&gt; + b^ sin^ (f&gt; = a^ sin^ (f} + h^ cos^ ^, 
giving tan^ ^ = Ij 

i.e. ^ = 45°, or 135°.

If a rectangle be formed whose sides are the tangents 
at Aj A', £, and B' the lines (1) and (2) are easily seen to

The directions of the equiconjugates are therefore along 
the diagonals of the circumscribing rectangle. 

The length of each equiconjugate is, by Art. 286, 



290. Supplemental chords. Def. The chords 
joining any point P on an ellipse to the extremities, P and 
P'j of any diameter of the ellipse are called supplemental 
chords. 

Supplemental chords are parallel to conjugate diatneters.

The product of these " m's " = g , so that, by Art. 281, 

the lines FR and P^' are parallel to conjugate diameters. 

This proposition may also be easily proved geometrically. 

For let V and V be the middle points of PJ2 and TR'. 

Since V and C are respectively the middle points of EP and J2E', 
the hne OF is parallel to FBI, Similarly CV is parallel to FB. 

Since GV bisects PE it bisects all chords parallel to PP, i.e. all 
chords parallel to GV. So CF' bisects all chords parallel to GV. 

Hence CF and GV are in the direction of conjugate diameters and 
therefore PP' and JPB,., being parallel to (7F and GV respectively, are 
parallel to conjugate diameters. 



CONJUGATE DIAMETERS. 261 

291. To find the equation to an ellipse referred to a 
pair of conjugate diameters. 

Let the conjugate diameters be CP and CD (Fig. Art. 
286), whose lengths are a' and h' respectively. 

If we transform the equation to the ellipse, referred to 
its principal axes, to CP and CD as axes of coordinates, 
then, since the origin is unaltered, it becomes, by Art. 134, 
of the form 

Ax' + 2Hxy-\-By'=l (1). 

Now the point P, {a, 0), lies on (1), so that 

Aa" = \ (2). 

So since Q, the point (0, h'), lies on (1), we have 

Bh'^ = 1. 

Hence A^-jz-, and B = -=-f„. 

a^ h^ 

Also, since CP bisects all chords parallel to CD, there- 
fore for each value of x we have two equal and opposite 
values of y. This cannot be unless 11=0. 

The equation then becomes 

^+^-=1 

Cor. If the axes be the equiconjugate diameters, the 
equation is x^ + y^ = a'^. The equation is thus the same in 
form as the equation to a circle. In the case of the ellipse 
however the axes are oblique. 

292. It will be noted that the equation to the ellipse, 
when referred to a pair of conjugate diameters, is of the 
same form as it is when referred to its principal axes. 
The latter are merely a particular case of a pair of conjugate 
diameters. 

Just as in Art. 262, it may be shewn that the equation 
to the tangent at the point (x, y') is 

Similarly for the equation to the polar. 



262 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Ex. If QVQ' be a double ordinate of the diameter CP, and if the 
tangent at Q meet CP in T, then CV . CT=CP'^. 

If Q be the point [x', y'), the tangent at it is

FOUR NORMALS TO AN ELLIPSE. 265 

293. To prove that, in general, four normals can he 
drawn from any point to an ellipse, and that the sum of the

The normal at any point, whose eccentric angle is ^, is 

r-^ = a^-h^^ de^. 

cos &lt;p sm &lt;p 

If this normal pass through the point (A, ^), we have 

J!L_JL=«v (1). 

COS &lt;/) sm &lt;jt&gt; ^ ' 

For a given point (li, k) this equation gives the 
eccentric angles of the feet of the normals which pass

and hence &lt;^i + ^2 + ^3 + &lt;/&gt;4 = (2n + 1)?? 

= an odd multiple of two right angles. 

294. We shall conclude the chapter with some ex- 
amples of loci connected with the ellipse. 

Ex. 1. Find the locus of the intersection of tangents at the ends 
of chords of an ellipse, which are of constant length 2c. 

Let QR be any such chord, and let the tangents at Q and R meet 
in a point P, whose coordinates are {h, k). 

Since QR is the polar of P, its equation is 

The abscissae of the points in which this straight line meets the 
ellipse are given by 



\^ a^j ~ h^ V ^y '

If x^ and .^2 be the roots of this equation, i.e. the abscissae of Q 
and R, we have 

^l + ^2-^-2p:;-^2;i;2' and ^1^2 -j2;,2 + ^2/^2- 

If 2/i and 2/2 be the ordinates of Q and R, we have from (1)

and 2+^=1' 

so that, by subtraction, 

_ i'h 

2/2 ~ 2/1 — ^2^ V.^2 ~ ^l/'

The condition of the question therefore gives 

Hence the point {h, k) always lies on the curve 

^ Ka'^y^J-y &amp;2 "^ aP ) V^ + P~-^j' 
which is therefore the locus of P. 

Ex. 2. Find the locus (1) of the middle points, and (2) of the poles, 
of normal chords of the ellipse. 

The chord, whose middle point is {h, k), is parallel to the polar of 
(h, k) , and is therefore 

i^-h)^,+ {y-k)^^=o (1). 

If this be a normal, it must be the same as 

aa^sec 6 - by cosec d = a^-h^ (2). 

We therefore have

Again, if (x^, y-y) be the pole of the normal chord (2), the latter

Any tangent to the second ellipse is

Let the tangents at the points where it meets the first ellipse meet 
in (h, k). Then (1) must be the same as the polar of {h, k) with 
respect to the first ellipse, i.e. it is the same as

THE HYPERBOLA. 



295. The hyperbola is a Conic Section in which the 
eccentricity e is greater than unity. 

To find the equation to a hyperbola. 

Let ZK be the directrix, 8 the focus, and let SZ be 
perpendicular to the directrix. 

There will be a point A on AZ^ such that 

SA--^e.AZ (ly 




272 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Since e&gt; 1, there will be another point A\ on /S'^ pro- 
duced, such that 

SA! = e.A'Z. (2). 

Let the length A A! be called 2c&amp;, and let C be the middle 
point of AA! . 

Subtracting (1) from (2), we have 
'la^AA'^e.A:Z-e.AZ 

= e\CA' + GZ'\-e\_GA - GZ] = e,2GZ, 

i.e. GZ=- , (3). 

Adding (1) and (2), we have 

e (AZ +A'Z) = SA' + SA = 2GS, 

i,e. e.AA' = 2.GS, 

and hence GS = ae (4). 

Let G be the origin, GSX the axis of x, and a straight 
line GT, through G perpendicular to GX, the axis of y. 

Let P be any point on the curve, whose coordinates are 
X and y, and let FM be the perpendicular upon the directrix, 
and PiV the perpendicular on ^^^. 

The focus aS' is the point (ae, 0). 

The relation JSP"" = e^ . PM^ = e^ . ZN^ then gives 

{x — aef + y^ = e^\ x 

i.e. x^ — 2aex + a^e^ + 2/^ = &amp;^x^ — ^aex + a^. 

Hence x" {e" - I) - y'^ = or {e" - \\ 

x^ v 
i.e. -- -— ^— - ==1 (5). 

Since, in the case of the hyperbola, e&gt; 1, the quantity 
a^ (e^ — 1) is positive. Let it be called b% so that the equa- 
tion (5) becomes 

X2 y2 

r2-b2=^ (^)' 

where b'^=^a'e^-a^^GjS^-GA' (7), 

and therefore GS^ = a^ + b^ „ . . . (8).

THE HYPERBOLA. FUNDAMENTAL EQUATION. 273 

296. The equation (6) may be written 
y^ s^ ^ _x- - a^ _{x — a) {x + a) 

PF^_AF.NA' 

so that PN^ : AJV . N"!' :: b' : d\ 

If we put x^O in equation (6), we have y'^- — lf, 
shewing that the curve meets the axis CZ in imaginary 
points. 

Def. The points A and A' are called the vertices of the 
hyperbola, C is the centre, -4^' is the transverse axis of the 
curve, whilst the line BB' is called the conjugate axis, 
where B and B' are two points on the axis of y equidistant 
from C, as in the figure of Art. 315, and such that 

B'G = CB^h. 

297. Since S is the point (ae, 0), the equation referred to the 
focus as origin is, by Art. 128, 

{x + ae)^ 2/2 _ 

~"^2 p-1' 

i.e. ^'+2--|' + e2-l = 0. 

Similarly, the equations, referred to the vertex A and foot of the 
directrix Z respectively as origins, wUl be found to be 

x^ y^ 2x ^ 

, a;2 w2 2a; ^ 1 

and 1^ +__=!_ 

a^ b'^ ae e^ 

^ The equation to the hyperbola, whose focus, directrix, and eccen- 
tricity are any given quantities, may be written down as in the case 
of the ellipse (Art. 249). 

298. There exist a second focus and a second directrix 
to the curve. 

On SO produced take a point S', such that 
SG=CS'^ae, 
and another point Z', such that 

a 



ZC = CZ' = 
e 



18 



274 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Draw Z'M' perpendicular to AA^ and let FM be pro- 
duced to meet it in M' . 

The equation (5) of Art. 295 may be written in the 
form 

tc^ + ^aex + cC-G^ + 2/^ = ^^ + ^aex + a^, 

i.e. {x + aef + 2/^ = e^(-+a3j , 

i.e. S'P^ = e" {Z'G + CNf = e^ . PM\ 

Hence any point F of the curve is such that its distance 
from S' is e times its distance from Z'K\ so that we should 
have obtained the same curve if we had started with S' as 
focus, Z'K^ as directrix, and the same eccentricity e. 

299. The difference of the focal distances of any point 
on the hyperbola is equal to the transverse axis. 

For (Fig., Art 295) we have 

SP = e.PM, and 8'P = e.PM'. 

Hence S'P - SP = e{PM' - PM) = e . MM' 

= e.ZZ' = 2e.CZ=2a

and 8'P^e. PM' = e . Z'N =e . C]^+ e .Z'C^bk' + a., 

where x' is the abscissa of the point P referred to the centre 
as origin. 

300. Latus-rectum of the Hyperbola. 

Let LSL' be the latus-rectum, i.e. the double ordinate 
of the curve drawn through S. 

By the definition of the curve, the semi-latus-rectum SL 
= e times the distance of L from the directrix

--^=1 (1) 

The equation may be written in either of the forms 

^=**\/5^ (^)' 



or a! = ±fli /^ + 1 (3).

From (2), it follows that, if ^ &lt; cf?^ i.e. if x lie between a 
and — (X, then y is impossible. There is therefore no part 
of the curve between A and A! . 

For all values of oi? &gt; o?- the equation (2) shews that 
there are two equal and opposite values of y^ so that the 
curve is symmetrical with respect to the axis of x. Also, 
as the value of x increases, the corresponding values of y 
increase, until, corresponding to an infinite value of x^ we 
have an infinite value of y. 

For all values of y^ the equation (3) gives two equal 
and opposite values to cc, so that the curve is symmetrical 
with respect to the axis of y. 

If a number of values in succession be given to x^ and 
the corresponding values of y be determined, we shall 
obtain a series of points, which will all be found to lie on a 
curve of the shape given in the figure of Art. 295. 

The curve consists of two portions, one of which extends 
in an infinite direction towards the positive direction of 
the axis of £c, and the other in an infinite direction towards 
the neofative end of this axis.

Similarly, if Q be without the curve, then y' &gt; PN, and 
we have -^ - ^ — 1 negative. 

303. To find the length of any central radius dravjn in 
a given direction. 

The equation (6) of Art. 295, when tran^rred to polar 
coordinates, becomes

This is the equation giving the value of any central

So long as tan^ ^&lt; -^, the equation (1) gives two equal

that all the curve is included within two straight lines 

drawn through C and inclined at an angle ± tan~-^ — to CX. 

Writing (1) in the form 

7* -— 



cos2^(^-tan2(9^ 

we see that r is least when the denominator is greatest, i.e. 
when ^ = 0. The radius vector CA is therefore the least. 

Also, when tan ^ = ± - , the value of r is infinite. 
a 

For values of between and tan"^ - the corresponding 

a 

positive values of r give the portion ^^ of the curve (Fig., 

Art. 295) and the corresponding negative values give the 

portion A'R'. 

7 

For values of 6 between and — tan~^ - , the positive 

a 

values of R give the portion AR^, and the negative values 

give the portion A'R^. 

The ellipse and the hyperbola since they both have a 
centre (7, such that all chords of the conic passing through 
it are bisected at it, are together called Central Conics. 

304. In the hyperbola any ordinate of the curve does 
not meet the circle on A A' as diameter in real points. 
There is therefore no real eccentric angle as in the case of 
the ellipse. 

"When it is desirable to express the coordinates of any 
point of the curve in terms of one variable, the substitutions 

X = a sec ^ and y = b tan &lt;f&gt; 

may be used; for these substitutions clearly satisfy the 
equation (6) of Art. 295. 

The angle ^ can be easily defined geometrically. 

On AA! describe the auxiliary circle, (Fig., Art. 306) 



278 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

and from the foot iV of any ordinate NP of the curve draw 
a tangent NU to this circle, and join CU. Then 

CU=CNco^NCU, 

i.e. x = GN=:a^QGNCU. 

The angle NCU is therefore the angle &lt;^. 

Also HU = CU tan (j&gt; = a ta&gt;ii^, 

so that JV^F : JSFU :: b : a. 

The ordinate of the hyperbola is therefore in a constant 
ratio to the length of the tangent drawn from its foot to 
the auxiliary circle. 

This angle eft is not so important an angle for the 
hyperbola as the eccentric angle is for the ellipse. 

305. Since the fundamental equation to the hyper- 
bola only differs from that to the ellipse in having — b^ 
instead of b% it will be found that many propositions for 
the hyperbola are derived from those for the ellipse by 
changing the sign of b^. 

Thus, as in Art. 260, the straight line y — mx + c meets 
the hyperbola in points which are real, coincident, or 
imaginary, according as 

c^&gt; — &lt; a^Tn^ — b^. 
As in Art. 262, the equation to the tangent at (x, y'^ is 

As in Art. 263, the straight line 

y = mx + sJa^TYi^ — b^ 
is always a tangent. 
The straight line 

X cos a + y sin a = j^ 
is a tangent, if p^ = a^ cos^ a — b^ sin^ a. 

The straight line Ix + my = n 
is a tangent, if ?i^ — aH^ - ¥m^. [Art. 264.] 



PROPERTIES OF THE HYPERBOLA. 



The normal at the point (x\ y') is, as in Art. 266, 



279 




306. With some modifications the properties of Arts. 
269 and 270 are true for the hyperbola also, if the 
corresponding figure be drawn. 

In the case of the hyperbola the tangent bisects the 
interior, and the normal the exterior, angle between the 
focal distances SP and S'P. 




It follows that, if an ellipse and a hyperbola have the 
same foci aS' and S', they cut at right angles at any common 
point P. For the tangents in the two cases are respec- 
tively the internal and external bisectors of the angle SPS', 
and are therefore at right angles. 

307. The equation to the straight lines joining the 
points {a sec ^, h tan (j&gt;) and {a sec &lt;^\ h tan ^') can be 
shewn to be 

X 4&gt;' — ^ y . ct&gt; + c{i 4&gt; + &lt;h'

Hence, by putting (f&gt;' — &lt;^, it follows that the tangent at 
the point {a sec ^, h tan ^) is 

1- sin &lt;/) = cos d). 

a 6 

It could easily be shewn that the equation to the 
normal is 

ax sin &lt;^ + by =^{a^ + b^) tan ^. 

308. The proposition of Art. 272 is true also for the 
hyperbola. 

As in Art. 273, the chord of contact of tangents 
from (iTj, 2/i) is 

^^1 _ y^j _ -1 

As in Art. 274, the polar of any point (x^, 2/1) is 

^^ y^i __ 1 

a^ 52 - • 

As in Arts. 279 and 281, the locus of the middle 
points of chords, which are parallel to the diameter y = 7nx, 
is the diameter y = m-^x, where 

b^

The proposition of Art. 278 is true for the hyperbola 
also, if we replace b^ by — b\ 

309. Director circle. The locus of the intersection 
of tangents which are at right angles is, as in Art. 271, 
found to be the circle x^ + y'^ = a^ — b% i. e. a circle whose 
centre is the origin and whose radius is Ja^ — b\ 

If 5^ &lt; a^, this circle is real. 

If b^ — a^, the radius of the circle is zero, and it reduces 
to a point circle at the origin. In this case the centre is 
the only point from which tangents at right angles can be 
drawn to the curve. 

If y^ &gt; a^, the radius of the circle is imaginary, so that 
there is no such circle, and so no tangents at right angles 
can be drawn to the curve. 



THE KECTANGULAR HYPERBOLA. 281 

310. Equilateral^ or Rectangular^ Hyperbola. 

The particular kind of hyperbola in which the lengths 
o£ the transverse and conjugate axes are equal is called an 
equilateral, or rectangular, hyperbola. The reason for the 
name "rectangular" will be seen in Art. 318. 

Since, in this case, b = a, the equation to the equilateral 
hyperbola, referred to its centre and axes, is x^ -y^ = a\ 

The eccentricity of the rectangular hyperbola is ^2. 

For, by Art. 295, we have, in this case, 
, a'' + ¥ 2t*2 
a^ a^ 

so that e — J2. 



311. Ex. The perpendiculars from the centre upon the tangent 
and normal at any point of the hyperbola -^—j-^ = l meet them in Q 

and R. Find the loci of Q and R. 

As in Art. 308, the straight line 

X cos a + y sin a =p 

is a tangent, if p^ — a^ cos^ a-h^ sin^ a. 

But p and a are the polar coordinates of Q, the foot of the perpen- 
dicular on this straight line from C. 

The polar equation to the locus of M is therefore 

r2 = a2cos2^-62sin2 6', 

i.e., in Cartesian coordinates, 

(x^ + y^f^a^x^-h^y^ 

If the hyperbola be rectangular, we have a = &amp;, and the polar 
equation is 

r2 = a2 (cos2 d - sin2 6) = a^ cos 26. 
Again, by Art. 307, any normal is 

axsin(t) + hy = {a^ + h^)ia,n&lt;() (1). 

The equation to the perpendicular on it from the origin is 

hx-ayB\n = (2). 

If we eliminate 0, we shall have the locus of R. 

'hx 
From (2), we have sind&gt;= — , 

ay' 

sin hx 

and then tan = / :=r — — j- — . 

&gt;/ 1 - sin^ ^Ja^y^— h^x^ 

Substituting in (1) the locus is 

{x^ + 2/2)2 i^aY - b^x^) = (a2 + ^2)2 ^y.

312. Asymptote. Def. An asymptote is a straight 
line, which meets the conic in two points both of which are 
situated at an infinite distance, but which is itself not alto- 
gether at infinity. 

313. To find the asymptotes of the hyperbola 

As in Art. 260, the straight line 

y = 7nx + c (1) 

meets the hyperbola in points, whose abscissae are given by 
the equation 

x" {¥ - a'Tiv')- 2a^mcx - a^ (c^ + 6^) = Q (2). 

If the straight line (1) be an asymptote, both roots of (2) 
must be infinite. 

Hence (C. Smith's Algebra, Art. 123), the coefiicients of 
x^ and X in it must both be zero. 

We therefcwre have 

h^ — a^jn^ = 0, and a^mc — 0. 



ASYMPTOTES. 285 

Hence m = =*=-, and c = 0. 

a 

Substituting these values in (1), we have, as the^fc 
quired equation, ^^ 

h 

-W =: =fc - aj. 

^ a 

There are therefore two asymptotes both passing 
through the centre and equally inclined to the axis of x, 
the inclination being 

tan"-^ — . 
a 

The equation to the asymptotes, written as one equa- 
tion, is 

Cor. For all values of c one root of equation (2) is 

infinite if 7?2 = ± — . Hence any straight line, which is 

parallel to an asymptote, meets the curve in one point at 
infinity and in one finite point. 

314. That the asymptote passes through two coincident points 
at infinity, i. e. touches the curve at infinity, may be seen by finding 
the equations to the tangents to the curve which pass through any 

point f rcj , — ajj^ j on the asymptote y=-x. 

As in Art. 305 the equation to either tangent through this point is 
y = mx + Ja^m^ - b^^ 

where - ar, = mx, -{• Ja^m^ - 6^ 

a ^ ^ 

i.e. on -clearing of surds, 

m2 {x^^ - a2) - 2m - x-,^+ (x.^ + a^) -,=0. 

One root of this equation is m = -, so that one tangent through 
the given point \^y=:- x, i.e. the asymptote itself. 



286 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



315. Geometrical construction fo7' the asymptotes. 

Let A' A be the transverse axis, and along the conju- 
gate axis measure off CB and CB\ each equal to h. 
Through B and B' draw parallels to the transverse axis 
and through A and A' parallels to the conjugate axis, and 
let these meet respectively in K^, K^^ K^, and K^, as in the 
figure. 




Clearly the equations of K^CK^ and K^CK^ are 

h , b 

y = — x, and y = x, 

^ a ' ^ a ' 

and these are therefore the equations of the asymptotes. 

316. Let any double ordinate FlSfP' of the hyperbola 
be produced both ways to meet the asymptotes in Q and Q\ 
and let the abscissa CN be x. 

Since P lies on the curve, we have, by Art. 302, 



NP^-slx'^-a'' 
a 



ASYMPTOTES. 287 



Since Q is on the asymptote whose equation is 3/ = - x, 

we have NQ = - £c 

a 

Hence PQ = NQ - NP = ^- (x' - slx'^ - a\ 

and QP' ^^- (x' + sj^-a\ 

a ^ ' 

Therefore PQ .QP' = ^ jcc'^ - (x'^ - a')} = h\ 

Hence, if from any point on an asymptote a straight 
line be drawn perpendicular to the transverse axis, the 
product of the segments of this line, intercepted between 
the point and the curve, is always equal to the square on 
the semi-conjugate axis. 

Again, 

PQj-{^-^W^r^) = ^ 

« ax' + Jx'''-a'' 

ah 

x' + \/x^ — a^ 

PQ is therefore always positive, and therefore the 
part of the curve, for which the coordinates are positive, 
•is altogether between the asymptote and the transverse 
axis. 

Also as X increases, i. e. as the point P is taken further 
and further from the centre C, it is clear that PQ con- 
tinually decreases ; finally, when x' is infinitely great, PQ 
is infinitely small. 

The curve therefore continually approaches the asymp- 
tote but never actually reaches it, although, at a very great 
distance, the curve would not be distinguishable from the 
asymptote. 

This property is sometimes taken as the definition of an 
asymptote. 

317. If SF be the perpendicular from ^S' upon an 
asymptote, the point F lies on the auxiliary circle. This 



288 COORDINATE GEOMETRY, 

follows from the fact that the asymptote is a tangent, 
whose point of contact happens to lie at infinity, or it may 
be proved directly. 
For 

GF= CS cos FCS =CS.%= j¥+¥ . -.-^^ - a. 

Also Z being the foot of the directrix, we have 

GA^= CS.cz, (Art. 295) 

and hence CF^ = CS . CZ, i.e. CS : CF :: CF : CZ. 

By Euc. YI. 6, it follows that l CZF= l CFS= a right 
angle, and hence that F lies on the directrix. 

Hence the perpendiculars from the foci on either asymptote 
meet it in the sam,e points as the corresponding directrix, 
and the common points of intersection lie on the auxiliary 
circle. 

318. Equilateral or Rectangular Hyperbola. 

In this curve (Art. 310) the quantities a and b are equal. 
The equations to the asymptotes are therefore y=.^x, i.e. 
they are inclined at angles =t 45° to the axis of x, and hence 
they are at right angles. Hence the hyperbola is generally 
called a rectangular hyperbola. 

319. Conjugate Hyperbola. The hyperbola which 
has BB' as its transverse axis, and A A' as its conjugate 
axis, is said to be the conjugate hyperbola of the hyperbola 
whose transverse and conjugate axes are respectively AA' 
and BB'. 

Thus the hyperbola 

¥ a'~^ ^ ^' 

is conjugate to the hyperbola 

^-^ = 1 (2).

which, by the same article, is the equation to the asymp- 
totes of (2). 

Thus a hyperbola and its conjugate have the sam.e 
asymptotes. 

The conjugate hyperbola is the dotted curve in the 
figure of Art. 323. 

320. Intersections of a hyperbola with a pair of con- 
jugate diameters. 

The straight line y = m^x intersects the hyperbola 

a^ b' 
in points whose abscissae are given by 

i.e. by the equation a^ — — — - . 

^ 0^ — a^m^ 

The points are therefore real or imaginary, according as 

a^TYi^ is &lt; or &gt; 6^, 

i.e. according as 

m^ is numerically &lt; or &gt; - (1), 

a 

i.e. according as the inclination of the straight line to the 
axis of X is less or greater than the inclination of the 
asymptotes. 

Now, by Art. 308, the straight lines y - tyi^x and y = m^x 
are conjugate diameters if 

^' /ox 

»^1^2 = ^ (2). 

Hence one of the quantities m^ and m^ must be less 

than - and the other greater than - . 
a a 

Let mj be &lt; -, so that, by (1), the straight line y = m^x 
meets the hyperbola in real points.

290 COOEDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Then, by (2), m^ must be &gt; - , so that, by (1), the straight 

CL 

line y = m^x will meet the hyperbola in imaginary points. 

It follows therefore that only one of a pair of conjugate 
diameters meets a hyperbola in real points. 

321. If a pair of diameters he conjugate with respect 
to a hyperbola, they will he conjugate with respect to its con- 
jugate hyperhola.

Now the equation to the conjugate hyperbola only 
differs from (1) in having — a^ instead of a^ and - h^ instead 
of h% so that the above pair of straight lines will be con- 
jugate with respect to it, if 

'^™= = l-^ = a^ (^)- 

But the relation (3) is the same as (2). 
Hence the proposition. 

322. If a pair of diameters he conjugate with respect 
to a hyperhola, one of them meets the hyperhola in real points 
and the other meets the conjugate hyperhola in real points. 

Let the diameters be 3/ = m^x and y = m^x, so that

Hence the proposition. 



323. If aiKiir of conjugate diameters meet the hyperbola 
and its conjugate in P and D, then (1) CP^ — CD^ = a^ — 6^, 
and (2) the tangents at P, D and the other ends of the 
diameters passing through them form a 'parallelogram whose 
vertices lie on the asymptotes and whose area is constant. 

Let P be any point on the hyperbola — — ^ = 1 whose 
coordinates are (a sec cf), h tan ^). 

The equation to the diameter CP is therefore

This straight line meets the conjugate hyperbola

that D is the point {a tan &lt;^, 6 sec ^). 

We therefore have 

CP" - a' sec^ «^ + 6Han2 &lt;/,, 

and CZ)^ - a^ tan^ &lt;^ + ¥ sec^ &lt;^. 

Hence 

CP2 _CD^^{a''- h^) (sec2 ^ - tan^ &lt;/&gt;) = c*2 - 51

those at D and F' on CZj. 

If tangents be therefore drawn at the points where a

SO that PK X perpendicular from G on TK ~ ah, 

i.e. area of the parallelogram CPKD — ah. 

Also the areas of the parallelograms CPKD, CDK^P\ 
CP'K'D', and CB'K;P are all equal. 

The area KK^K'K^ therefore = 4a6. 

Cor. PK^ CD = D'C = K^P, so that the portion of a 
tangent to a hyperbola intercepted between the asymptotes 
is bisected at the point of contact. 

324. Relation hefweert the equation to the hyperhola, 
the equation to its asymptotes, and the equation to the conju- 
gate hyperbola. 

The equations to the hyperbola, the asymptotes, and the 
conjugate hyperbola are respectively 

5-F = i • W- 

%-%-' -(2)- 

and-^-|^ = -l (3). 

a^ 0" 

We notice that the equation (2) differs from equation (1) 
by a constant, and that the equation (3) differs from (2) by 
exactly the same quantity that (2) differs from (1). 

If now we transform the equations in any way we 
please — by changing the origin and directions of the axes — 
by the most general substitutions of Art. 132 and by 
multiplying the equations by any — the same — constant, 
we shall alter the left-hand members of (1), (2), and (3) in 
exactly the same way, and the right-hand constants in the 
equations will still be constants, and differ in the same way 
as before. 

Hence, whatever be the form of the equation to a 
hyperbola, the equation to the asymptotes only differs from 
it by a constant, and the equation to the conjugate 
hyperbola differs from that to the asymptotes by the same 
constant. 



294 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

325. As an example of the foregoing article, let it be required 
to find the asymptotes of the hyperbola 

Sx^-5xy-2y^ + 5x+ny-8 = ...(1). 

Since the equation to the asymptotes only differs from it by a 
constant, it must be of the form 

Sx^-5xy-2y^ + 5x + lly + c = (2). 

Since (2) represents the asymptotes it must represent two straight 
lines. The condition for this is (Art. 116) 

3(-2)c + 2.|.-V-(-f)-3(W-(-2)(t)2-c(-t)2=0, 
i.e. c=-12. 

The equation to the asymptotes is therefore 

3a;2 - 5xy - 2tf + 5a; + 11?/ - 12 = 0, 
and the equation to the conjugate hyperbola is 

3a;2 - 5xy -2i/ + 5x + lly -16 = 0. 

326. As another example we see that the equation to any 
hyperbola whose asymptotes are the straight lines 

Ax + By + G = and A-^x + B-^y + 0-^ = 0, 

is {Ax + By + C){A^x + B^y + Gj) = \'' (1), 

where X is any constant. 

For (1) only differs by a constant from the equation to the 
asymptotes, which is 

{Ax + By + C){A^x + B^y + G^) = (2). 

If in (1) we substitute - A^ for X^ ^e shall have the equation to its 
conjugate hyperbola. 

It follows that any equation of the form 

[Ax + By + C) {A^x + B-^y + Oj) = X^ 

represents a hyperbola whose asymptotes are 

Ax + By + C = 0, and A^x + B^y + G^ = 0. 

Thus the equation x{x + y) = a^ represents a hyperbola whose 
asymptotes are x = and x + y = 0. 

Again, the equation x'^ + 2xy cot 2a - y^ = a'^, 

i.e. {x cot a- y) {x ta.n a + y) = a^, 

represents a hyperbola whose asymptotes are 

X cot a-y = 0, and x tan a + y = 0. 

327. It would follow from the preceding articles that the 
equation to any hyperbola whose asymptotes are x = and ?/ = is 
a;2/ = const. 



THE HYPERBOLA. EXAMPLES. 295 

The constant could be easily determined in terms of the semi- 
transverse and semi-conjugate axes. 

In Art. 328 we shall obtain this equation by direct transformation 
from the equation referred to the principal axes.

Then, since PH and HR are parallel respectively to CL 
and CM, we have l PHR ^LLCM=a. 

Hence GM^ GN+HR=CHcob a + HPco^a 
and MP^BP- UN ^ HP sin a - C^sin a 

Therefore, since Cilf and MP satisfy the equation (1), 
- "we have 

Hence, since (A, ^) is any point on the hyperbola, the 
required equation is 

xy = — 4— ■ 

This is often written in the form xy — c^, where 4c^ 
equals the sum of the squares of the semiaxes of the 
hyperbola. 

Similarly, the equation to the conjugate hyperbola is, 
when referred to the asymptotes, 

^y = J—. 

329. To find the equation to the tangent at any point 
of the hyperbola xy = c^. 

Let (cc', y') be any point P on the hyperbola, and 
{x", y") a point Q on it, so that we have 

^y = c2 (1), 

and x"y" = 0^ (2). 

The equation to the line PQ is then 

2/ -y'=fc|^ (»-=«') (3).

Let now the point Q be taken indefinitely near to P, so 
that x' — X ultimately, and therefore, by Art. 149, FQ 
becomes the tangent at P. 



Then (4) becomes

The required equation is therefore 

x'i/ + xy — Ixy — 2g^ (5). 

The equation (5) may also be written in the form 

% + K-^ -^ (6).

330. The tangent at any point of a hyperbola cuts off a triangle 
of constant area from the asymptotes, and the portion of it intercepted 
hetioeen the asymptotes is bisected at the point of contact. 

Take the asymptotes as axes and let the equation to the hyperbola 

be xy = c^. 

The tangent at any point P is — + — , = 2. 

X y 

This meets the axes in the points [2x' , 0) and (0, 2?/'). 
If these points be L and U, and the centre be C, we have 

GL = 'ix', 2in(iGL' = 2y'. 
If 2a be the angle between the asymptotes, the area of the triangle 
LGL' = ^CL . OL' sin 2a = 2a;'2/'sin 2a= — ^— . 2 sinacos a = a6. 

(Art. 328.) 

Also, since L is the point (2a;', 0) and L' is (0, 2y'), the middle 
point of LL' is (x', y'), i.e. the point of contact P. 



ASYMPTOTES AS AXES. 299 

331. As in Art. 274, the polar of any point (x^, y^ 
with respect to the curve can be shewn to be 

Since, in general, the point (aj^, y^ does not lie on the 
curve the equation to the polar cannot be put into the form 
(6) of Art. 329. 

332. The equation to the normal at the point {x\ y') 
is y-y' =^m{x— x'), where m is chosen so that this line is 
perpendicular to the tangent

If 0) be the angle between the asymptotes we then 

obtain, by Art. 93, 

x' — y cos 0) 

m^— -, , 

y — X cos 0) 

so that the required equation to the normal is 

y (if' — X cos w) — X (x — y cos w) = y"^ — x'. 

Also cos w = cos 2a = cos a — sm a =r — - — ~ 
L 0^ + 6 . 

If the hyperbola be rectangular, then co = 90°, and the 
equation to the normal becomes xx — yy' — x'^ — y'^. 

333. Equation referred to the asymptotes. 
One Variable. 

The equation xy = c^ is clearly satisfied by the substitu- 
tion x = ct and y = - . 

Hence, for all values of t, the point whose coordinates 
are ict, - j lies on the curve, and it may be called the point 

The tangent at the point "^" is by Art. 329,

Also the normal is, by the last article,

y (l — f cos iji)—x {f — cos (o) == - (1 - ^*), 



or, when the hyperbola is rectangular, 

The equations to the tangents at the points ^'t" and " t" 



are 



-+yt^=. 2c, and - + yt^= 2c, 
h h 

and hence the tangents meet at the point 

Vi + ^2 ' ^1 + tj ' 

The line joining " t^" and " ^2/' which is the polar of this 
point, is therefore, by Art. 331, 

X + yt^t^ = c(ti + 1^. 

This form also follows by writing down the equation 
to the straight line joining the points 



(ct,, g and (ct,, Q 



334. Ex. 1. If a rectangular hyperbola circumscribe a triangle, 
it also passes through the orthocentre of the triangle. 

Let the equation to the curve referred to its asymptotes be 

a:y = c'^ (1). 

Let the angular points of the triangle be P, Q, and R, and let their 
coordinates be 

j-espectively. 

As in the last article, the equation to QR is 
x + yt2ts=c{t^ + ts). 

The equation to the straight line, through P perpendicular to QR^ 
is therefore 

h 



I.e. 



y + ctihh=hh[f + jjj] (2)-

Similarly, the equation to the straight line through Q perpendicular 
to RP is 

2/ + c«iU3=¥ir^ + j-7T] (^)- 

The common point of (2) and (3) is clearly 

{~4j^ "'''''') ^'^' 

and this is therefore the orthocentre. 

But the coordinates (4) satisfy (1). Hence the proposition. 

Also if ( ct^,-\ he the orthocentre of the points " ij," " t^" and 
" ig," we have t^t^t^t^— - 1. 

Ex. 2. If a circle and the rectangular hyperbola (xy = c^ meet in 
the four points "ti," "f2&gt;" "^3&gt;" ^nd ^^t^^" prove that 

(1) ti«2^3«4=l, 

(2) the centre of mean position of the four points bisects the 
distance between the centres of the two curves, 

and (3) the centre of the circle through the points "ij," "f2»" "^g" ^^ 

Let the equation to the circle be 

x^ + y^-2gx-^y + k = 0, 
so that its centre is the point {g,f). 

Any point on the hyperbola is (ct,jj. If this lie on the circle, 

we have cH^ + -^-2gct-2f- + k = 0, 

so that i4 - 2^ t^+-t^--^t +1 = (1). 

c c^ c ^ ' 

If t^ , fg, *3, and ^4 be the roots of this equation, we have, by Art. 2, 

hhhh='^ (2), 

h + h + t, + t,=^ (3),

and *2M4 + *3*4*1 + *4M2+M2*3= (4).

THE POLAR EQUATION, FOCUS BEING POLE. 307

If the initial line, instead of being the axis, be such that the axis 
is inclined at an angle y to it, then, in the previous article, instead of 
6 we must substitute d -y. 

The equation in this case is then

337. To trace the curve — = \—e cos 6. 

r 

Case I. e = 1^ so that the equation is - = 1 - cos 6. 

When is zero, we have - — 0, so that r is infinite. As 

r 

increases from 0° to 90°, cos^ decreases from 1 to 0, 

and hence - increases from to 1, i.e. r decreases from 
r 

infinity to I. 

As increases from 90° to 180°, cos^ decreases from 

to — 1, and hence - increases from 1 to 2, i.e. r decreases 
r 

from I to ^l. 

Similarly, as changes from 180° to 270°, r increases 

from - to I, and, as changes from 270° to 360°, r increases 
from ^ to CO . 

The curve is thus the parabola co FPLAL'P'F' oo of 
Art. 197.

Case II. e&lt;l. When is zero, we have - = 1— e, 

r 

i.e. r— r . This gives the point A' in the figure of Art. 

247. 

As 6 increases from 0° to 90°, cos B decreases from 1 to 

0, and therefore 1— ecos^ increases from 1 -e to 1, i.e. - 

r 

increases from 1— e to 1, i.e. r decreases from to I. 

1— e 

"We thus obtain the portion A'PBL. 

As 6 increases from 90° to 180°, cos^ decreases from 
to — 1, and therefore 1—e cos increases from 1 to 1 + e, 

i.e. - increases from 1 to 1 + e, i.e.r decreases from I to r . 

r 1 +e 

We thus obtain the portion LA of the curve, where 

SA = ^. 

Similarly, as increases from 180° to 270° and then to 
360°, we have the portions AL' and L'B'P'A'. 

Since cos 6 = cos (— 6) = cos (360° — 6), the curve is sym- 
metrical about the line SA'. 

Case III. e &gt; 1. When is zero, 1 -e cos 6 is equal 
to 1—e, i.e. — (e— 1), and is therefore a negative quantity, 
since e &gt; 1. This zero value of gives r = — I — (e — 1). 

We thus have the point A' in the figure of Art. 295. 

Let 6 increase from 0° to cos~^ ( " ) • Thus 1—e cos 
increases algebraically from — (e — 1) to — 0, 
i.e. — increases algebraically from — (e — 1) to — 0, 

i.e. r decreases algebraically from = to — cc . 

For these values of 6 the radius vector is therefore 
negative and increases in numerical length from to oo . 



THE POLAR EQUATION, FOCUS BEING POLE. 309 

We thus have the portion A'P^R oo of the curve. For 
this portion r is negative. 

If 6 be very slightly greater than cos~^ - , then cos 6 is 

slightly less than - , so that 1 -e cos is small and positive, 

and therefore r is very great and is positive. Hence, as 6 

increases through the angle cos~^ - , the value of r changes 

from — cx) to + 00 . 

As 6 increases from cos~^— to tt, 1— ecos^ increases 

e 

from to 1 + e and hence r decreases from oo to q . 

1 +e 

Now is &lt; — - . Hence the point A, which corresponds 

to 6^ = TT, is such that SA &lt; SA'. 

For values of 9 between cos~^- and tt we therefore 

e 

have the portion, ao RPA^ of the curve. For this portion 
r is positive. 

As increases from tt to 27r — cos~^ - , e cos 9 increases 

e 

from — e to 1, so that 1 — ecos^ decreases from 1 +e to 0, 

and therefore r increases from — to oo . Corresponding 

to these values of 6 we have the portion AL'R^ oo of the 
curve, for which r is positive. 

Finally, as increases from Stt-cos"^- to 27r, ecos^ 

e 

increases from 1 to e, so that 1 — e cos 6 decreases algebraic- 
ally from to 1 — e, i.e. - is negative and increases 

r 

numerically from to e— 1, and therefore r is negative and 

decreases from go to . Corresponding to these values 

of 6 we have the portion, oo R{A\ of the curve. For this 
portion r is negative. 



310 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

r is therefore always positive for the right-hand branch 
of the curve and negative for the left-hand branch. 

It will be noted that the curve is described in the order 

A'P^R' 00 00 RPAL'R^ oo oo R^A'. 

338. In Case III. of the last article, let any straight line be 
dravm through S to meet the nearer branch in ^, and the further 
branch in q. 

The vectorial angle of p is XS-p, and we have 

I 
^~l-e cos XS;p ' 

The vectorial angle of q is not XSq but the angle that qS produced 
makes with SX, i.e. it is XSq^ir. Also for the point q the radius 
vector is negative so that the relation (1) of Art. 335 gives, for the 
point a, 

^ l-ecos{XSq-f^7r) 1 + ecosXSq' 

*-^* ^^^~l + ecosXSq' 

This is the relation connecting the distance, Sq, of any point on 
the further branch of the hyperbola with the angle XSq that it makes 
with the initial line.

Also the asymptote CQ makes an angle cos~^ — with the 
axis. The perpendicular on it from S therefore makes an 
angle ^ + cos-i - . 

Hence, by Art. 88, the polar equation to the asymptote 
CQ is 

h = r cos ^ — 9 — cos~^ - = r sin 6 — cos~^ - . 
The polar equation to the other asymptote is similarly 
h — r cos 6- y-^ cos "^ - ) = — r sin {d + cos~* - j . 

341. Ex. 1. In any conic, prove that 

(1) the sum of the reciprocals of the segments of any focal chord 
is constant, and 

(2) the sum of the reciprocals of two perpendicular focal chords is 
constant. 

Let PSP' be any focal chord, and let the vectorial angle of P be a, 
so that the vectorial angle of P' is ir + a.

of Art. 335, we have

Transforming to Cartesian coordinates this equation becomes

If the original conic be a parabola, we have e = l, and equation (1) 
becomes y^ = lx, so that the locus is a parabola whose vertex is S and 
latus-rectum I. 

If e be not equal to unity, equation (1) may be written in the form 

^ (i-')[-ir^J+'/=4-(^j 

and therefore represents an ellipse or a hyperbola according as the 
original conic is an ellipse or a hyperbola. 



POLAR EQUATION TO THE TANGENT. 313 

342. To find the 'polar equation of the tangent at any 
point P of the conic section - — \~e cos B. 

Let P be the point (rj, a), and let Q be another point

This is the equation to the straight line joining two

To obtain the equation of the tangent at P we take Q 
indefinitely close to P, i.e. we put /5 = a, and the equation 
(3) then becomes 

- =cos (^ — a) — ecos^ (4). 

This is the required equation to the tangent at the 
point a. 



314 COOKDINATE GEOMETKY. 

343. If we assume a suitable form for the equation to the 
joining chord we can more easily obtain the required equation. 

Let the required equation be 

-=Lcos(^-7) -ecos^ (1). 

[On transformation to Cartesian coordinates this equation is 
easily seen to represent a straight line ; also since it contains two 
arbitrary constants, L and 7, it can be made to pass through any two 
points.] 

If it pass through the point {r^^ a), we have 

1 - e cos a =— =Xi cos (a - 7) - e cos a, 

i.e. I, cos (a -7) = ! (2). 

Similarly, if it pass through the point {r^, /3) on the curve, we have 

Lcos(/3-7) = l (3). 

Solving these, we have, [since a and ^ are not equal] 

Substituting this value m (3), we obtam i = sec— ^ . 



The equation (1) is then

Let the tangents at the points v^hose vectorial angles

The coordinates r^ and 61 must therefore satisfy equation

Similarly,

• POLAR EQUATION TO THE POLAR. 315 

Subtracting (2) from (1), we have 

cos ($1 — a) = cos (^1 — /?),

The equation to the tangent at the point a is

Let the equation to the normal be 

^cos^ + ^sin^ = - (2), 

i.e. Ax + Bi/ = l (3). 



316 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Since (1) and (3) are perpendicular, we have 

A (cos a-e) + Bs&gt;ma = (4). 

Since (2) goes through the point ( ^"^ , a j we have

Solving (4) and (5), we have

the equation to the tangent at the point a is obtained by substituting 
a - 7 and ^ - 7 for a and 6 in the equation of Art. 342.

conic meet in a point T, and if the straight line PQ meet the directrix 
corresponding to S in a point K, then the angle KST is a right angle.

Also the equation to the directrix is, by Art. 339,

If we solve the equations (1) and (2), we shall obtain the polar 
coordinates of K. 

But, by subtracting (2) from (1), we have 

so that SK bisects the exterior angle between SP and SQ. 

Also, by equation (3) of Art. 344, we have the vectorial angle of T

Hence Z KST= L KSX - z TSX='^ . 

Ex. 2. S is the focus and P and Q tioo points on a conic such that 
the angle PSQ is constant and equal to 25; prove that 

(1) the locus of the intersection of tangents at P and Q is a conic 
section ivhose focus is S, 

and (2) the line PQ always touches a conic ivhose focus is S. 

(1) Let the vectorial angles of P and Q be respectively 7 + 5 and 
7 - S, where 7 is variable. 

By equation (4) of Art. 342, the tangents at P and Q are therefore 
- = cos(6*-7-5)-ecos^ (1), 

and - = cos(6'-7 + 5)-ecos^ .(2). 

If, between these two equations, we eliminate the variable quantity 
7, we shall have the locus of the point of intersection of the two 
tangents. 

Subtracting (2) from (1), we have 

cos {e--y-8) = cos (^ - 7 + 8). 
Hence, (since 5 is not zero) we have 7=^.

Hence the required locus is a conic whose focus is 8, whose latus

It is therefore an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola, according as 
e sec 5 is &lt; = &gt;1, i.e. according as cos 8&gt; = &lt;:e.

Comparing this with equation (4) of Art. 342, we see that it always

If the diameter of the circle, which passes through S, be inclined

CHAPTER XV. 

GENERAL EQUATION OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 
TRACING OF CURVES. 



348. Particular cases of Conic Sections. The 

general definition of a Conic Section in Art. 196 was that 
it is the locus of a point P which moves so that its distance 
from a given point S is in a constant ratio to its perpen- 
dicular distance FM from a given straight line ZK. 

When S does not lie on the straight line ZK, we have 
found that the locus is an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola 
according as the eccentricity e is &lt;= or &gt; 1. 

The Circle is a sub-case of the Ellipse. For the 
equation of Art. 139 is the same as the equation (6) of 
Art. 247 when h^ = a^, i.e. when e = 0. In this case 



The Circle is therefore a 



CS=0, and SZ=:--ae = oo 
e 

Conic Section, whose eccentricity is zero, and whose direc- 
trix is at an infinite distance. 

Next, let S lie on the straight line ZK, so that S and Z 
coincide. 

In this case, since 

SF=e.FM, 
we have

GENERAL EQUATION OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 323 

If e = 1, then PSM is a right angle, and the locus 
becomes two coincident straight lines coinciding with SX. 

If e&lt; 1, the z PSM is imaginary, and the locus consists 
of two imaginary straight lines. 

If, again, both KK' and S be at infinity and S be on 
KK\ the lines SU and SU' of the previous figure will be 
two straight lines meeting at infinity, i.e. will be two 
parallel straight lines. 

Finally, it may happen that the axes of an ellipse may 
both be zero, so that it reduces to a point. 

Under the head of a conic section we must therefore 
include : 

(1) An Ellipse (including a circle and a point). 

(2) A Parabola. 

(3) A Hyperbola. 

(4) Two straight lines, real or imaginary, inter- 
secting, coincident, or parallel. 

349. To shew that the general equation of the second 
degree 

aoi? + 2hxy + hy^ + 2gx + 2/?/ + c = (1) 

always represents a conic section. 

Let the axes of coordinates be turned through an angle 
6, so that, as in Art. 129, we substitute for x and y the 
quantities x cos 6 — y sin 6 and x sin 6 + y cos 9 respec- 
tively. 

The equation (1) then becomes 

a (x cos — y sin Oy + 2h (x cos — y sin 0) {x sin + y cos 6) 

+ h(x sin + y cos Oy + 2g (x cos — y sin 6) 

+ 2/{x sin 6 + y cos 6) + c = 0, 

i. e. x^ (a cos^ + 2h cos sin + b sin^ 0) 

+ 2xy {h (cos^ - sin^ 0)-(a — h) cos 6 sin 6] 

+ 2/^ {a sin^ 6 - 2h cos OsinB + h cos^ 6) + 2x (g cos +/sin 0) 

+ 2y{fcosO-gsine) + c = (2) . 

21—2 



324 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Now choose the angle 6 so that the coefficient of xy in 
this equation may vanish, 

i. e. so that h (cos^ 6 — sin^ 0) — (a — h) sin 6 cos ^, 

i. e. 2h cos 20 = (a — b) sin 20, 

2h 
i. e. so that tan 20 = -, . 



a 



Whatever be the values of a, b, and h, there is always 
a value of satisfying this equation and such that it lies 
between — 45° and + 45°. The values of sin and cos are 
therefore known. 

On substituting their values in (2), let it become 

Ax'' + JBy'' + 2Gx + 2Fy + c = (3). 

First, let neither A nor B be zero. 

The equation (3) may then be written in the form 

Gy „/ i&lt;^V ^' ^' 



,/ Gy „/ ry g' r' 

A[x^-)^B[y^-j^)=-^^^-c.

If — and -^ be both positive, the equation represents an 

ellipse. (Art. 247.) 

K K 

If -J and — be one positive and the other negative, it 
An 

represents a hyperbola (Art. 295). If they be both 

negative, the locus is an imaginary ellipse. 

If X be zero, then (4) represents two straight lines, 
which are real or imaginary according as A and B have 
opposite or the same signs. 



CENTRE OF A CONIC SECTION. 325 

Secondly^ let either J. or ^ be zero, and let it be ^. 
Then (3) can be written in the form 

G F^ 



-(-3 



F\2 



^ "^ 2G 2BG 



y 



0. 

Transform the origin to the point whose coordinates 
are 

__c_ J^ _F 
~2G'^2M' ~B 
This equation then becomes 

By^+2Gx^0, 

2G 
^.e. r^--^^' 

which represents a parabola, (Art. 197.) 

If, in addition to A being zero, we also have G zero, the 
equation (3) becomes 

By^ + 2Fy + c = 0, 



F F^ G 

'^^B^^\/w-r 

and this represents two parallel straight lines, real or 
imaginary. 

Thus in every case the general equation represents one 
of the conic sections enumerated in Art. 348. 

350. Centre of a Conic Section. Def. The 

centre of a conic section is a point such that all chords of 
the conic which pass through it are bisected there. 

When the equation to the conic is in the form 

ax^ + 2hxy + by'^ + g-0 (1), 

the origin is the centre. 

For let (x, y) be any point on (1), so that we have 

aa;'2 + 2Aa;y + 62/'' + c = (2). 

This equation may be written in the form 

a (- ^f + 2A (- a;') (- y') + 6 (- yj + c = 0, 

and hence shews that the point (— a:', — y'^ also lies on (1). 



326 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

But the points {x\ y) and {—x\ —y) lie on the same 
straight line through the origin, and are at equal distances 
from the origin. 

The chord of the conic which passes through the origin 
and any point {x, y) of the curve is therefore bisected at 
the origin. 

The origin is therefore the centre. 

351. When the equation to the conic is given in the 
form 

aa? + 27t£C2/ + hy"^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = (1), 

the origin is the centre only when both f and g are zero. 

For, if the origin be the centre, then corresponding 
to each point {x, y) on (1), there must be also a point 
(—a;', —y') lying on the curve. 

Hence we must have 

ax^ + 'i.hxy + hy'^ + 2gx +'ify'-\-c = (2), 

and ax'^ + Ihx'y' + hy'^^ - 2gx' -2fy' + c=^0 (3). 

Subtracting (3) from (2), we have 

gx +fy' - 0. 

This relation is to be true for all the points {og\ y') 
which lie on the curve (1). But this can only be the case 
when g — and f= 0. 

352. To obtain the coordinates of the centre of the 
conic given hy the general equation, and to obtain the 
equation to the curve referred to axes through the centre 
parallel to the original axes. 

Transform the origin to the point (S, y)j so that for x 
and y we have to substitute x + x and y + y. The equation 
then becomes 

a{x + xf + 2h{x + x){y + y) + b (y + yY + 2g(x + x) 

i. e. ax^ + 2hxy + by^ + 2x (ax + hy + g) + 2y (Jix + by +f) 
+ ax^'}-2hxy + by'^ + 2gx + 2fy + c=^0 (2). 



EQUATION REFERKED TO THE CENTRE. 327 

If the point (x, y) be the centre of the conic section, the 
coefficients of x and y in the equation (2) must vanish, so 
that we have 

ax + hy + g = (3), 

and hx + hy +f = (4). 

Solving (3) and (4), we have, in general, 

With these values the constant term in (2) 

= a^ + 2hxy + hy^ + 2gx + Ify + c 

= X {ax + hy + g) + y (hx + hy +/) + gx+/y + c 

= gx + fy + c (6), 

by equations (3) and (4), 

abc + 2 fgh — af^ — bi/^ — ch^ , ,. _, 

= ^^ — — , by equations (5), 

A 

~ab^^^' 

where A is the discriminant of the given general equation 
(Art. 118). 

The equation (2) can therefore be written in the form 

aaf + 2hxy + by^ + -7 — ^ = 0. 

This is the required equation referred to the new axes 
through the centre. 

Ex. Find the centre of the conic section 

2x^ - 5xy - Sy^ ~x-iy + Q = 0, 
and its equation when transformed to the centre. 

The centre is given by the equations 2x~^y-^ = 0, and 
-^x-By -2 = 0, sothatS=-y, and ?/= -|. 
The equation referred to the centre is then 
2x^-5xy-Sy^ + c' = 0, 
where c'= -|. S-2.?7 + 6 = ^+f + 6 = 7. (Art. 352.) 

The required equation is thus 

2x^-5xy-3y^ + 7 = 0. 



328 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

353. Sometimes the equations (3) and (4) of the last 
article do not give suitable values for x and y. 

For, if ah — 1^ be zero, the values of x and y in (5) are 
both infinite. When ah — h^ is zero, the conic section is a 
parabola. 

The centre of a parabola is therefore at infinity. 

Again, if - = - = ^ , the result (5) of the last article is 

of the form ~ and the equations (3) and (4) reduce to the 
same equation, viz., 

ax + hy + g = 0. 

We then have only one equation to determine the 
centre, and there is therefore an infinite number of centres 
all lying on the straight line 

ax -{-hy -{-g — O. 

In this case the conic section consists of a pair of 
parallel straight lines, both parallel to the line of centres. 

354. The student who is acquainted with the Dif- 
ferential Calculus will observe, from equations (3) and (4) 
of Art. 352, that the coordinates of the centre satisfy the 
equations that are obtained by difierentiating, with regard 
to x and y, the original equation of the conic section. 

It will also be observed that the coefficients of x, y, and 
unity in the equations (3), (4), and (6) of Art. 352 are the 
quantities (in the order in which they occur) which make 
up the determinant of Art. 118. 

This determinant being easy to write down, the student 
may thence recollect the equations for the centre and the 
value of c. 

The reason why this relation holds will appear from the 
next article. 

355. Ex. Find the condition that the general equation of the 
second degree may represent two straight lines. 

The centre {x, y) of the conic is given by 

ax-\-hy-\-g = (1), 

and hx + by+f=0 (2). 



EQUATION TO THE ASYMPTOTES. 329 

Also, if it be transformed to the centre as origin, the equation 
becomes 

ax^+2hx7j + hif + c' = (3), 

where c' = gx+fy + c. 

Now the equation (3) represents two straight lines if c' be zero, 
i.e. if gx+fy + c—Q (4). 

The equation therefore represents two straight lines if the relations 
(1), (2), and (4) be simultaneously true. 

Eliminating the quantities ^ and y from these equations, we have, 
by Art. 12, 

a, h, g 

h, b, f =0. 

This is the condition found in Art. 118. 

356. To find the equation to the asymptotes of the conic 
section given hy the general equation of the second degree. 

Let the equation be 

a'3(? + 2hxy + hy'^ + 2gx + ^fy + c-O... (1). 

Since the equation to the asymptotes has been shewn to 
differ from the equation to the curve only in its constant 
term, the required equation must be 

ax^ + '2hxy + hy^ + 2gx + 2fy + c + A, = (2). 

Also (2) is to be a pair of straight lines. 
Hence 
ah (c + X) + ^fgh - af - 6/ - (c + X) K- = 0. (Art. 116.) 

ahG + 2fgh-af^-hg^-c¥ A 

ineretore A = — ■ ; ,„ — = -^ — j-^. 

ao — a^ ab — A" 

The required equation to the asymptotes is therefore 

ax^ + 2hxy + hy^ + 2gx + 2/y + c j — 7^= . . .(2). 

Cor. Since the equation to the hyperbola, which is 
conjugate to a given hyperbola, differs as much from the 
equation to the common asymptotes as the original equation 
does, it follows that the equation to the hyperbola, which is 
conjugate to the hyperbola (1), is 

ax^ + 2hxy + hy"^ + 2gx + 2fy + c— 2 - — y^ = 0. 



330 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

357. To determine hy an examination of the general 
equation what hind of conic section it represents. 

[On applying the method of Art. 313 to the ellipse and 
parabola, it would be found that the asymptotes of the 
ellipse are imaginary, and that a parabola only has one 
asymptote, which is at an infinite distance and perpen- 
dicular to its axis.] 

The straight lines as(? + Ihxy + hy'^ = (1) 

are parallel to the lines (2) of the last article, and hence 
represent straight lines parallel to the asymptotes. 

Now the equation (1) represents real, coincident, or 
imaginary straight lines according as J^ is &gt;= or &lt;a6, 
i.e. the asymptotes are real, coincident, or imaginary, 
according as A^ &gt; = or &lt; ab^ i. e. the conic section is a hyper- 
bola, parabola, or ellipse, according as 1^ &gt; = or &lt; ah. 

Again, the lines (1) are at right angles, i.e. the curve is 
a rectangular hyperbola, if a ^-h — ^. 

Also, by Art. 143, the general equation represents a 
circle if a = h, and h = 0. 

Finally, by Art. 116, the equation represents a pair of 
straight lines if A = ; also these straight lines are parallel 
if the terms of the second degree form a perfect square, i.e. 
if h^ = ah. 

358. The results for the general equation 

ao(? + 2hxy + hy^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = 

are collected in the following table, the axes of coordinates 
being rectangular.

EXAMPLES. 331 

If the axes of coordinates be oblique, the lines (1) of Art. 356 are 
at right angles if a + 6- 2/icos a;=0 (Art. 93); so that the conic 
section is a rectangular hyperbola ii a + b-2h cos w = 0. 

Also, by Art. 175, the conic section is a circle if &amp; = a and 

h= a cos la. 

The conditions for the other cases in the previous article are the 
same for both oblique and rectangular axes.

a^ + 2hxy + b'lf' + 2^cc + yy + c = (1), 

and to find its latus rectum. 

First Method. Since the curve is a parabola we 
have A^ = ab, so that the terms of the second degree form 
a perfect square. 

Put then a — c^ and 6 = yS^, so that h = a(B, and the 
equation (1) becomes 

{ax + Pyf + 2gx-v 2fy + c = (2). 

Let the direction of the axes be changed so that the 

straight line ax + Py = 0, i.e. y = — -^x, may be the new- 
axis of -Z". 




We have therefore to turn the axes through an angle

The equation (3) represents a parabola whose latus 

rectum is 2 , , whose axis is parallel to the new axis 

(a' + JS'f 
of X, and whose vertex referred to the new axes is the 
point (R, K). 

360. Equation of the axis, and coordinates of the 
vertex, referred to the original axes. 

Since the axis of the curve is parallel to the new axis of 
X, it makes an angle 9 with the old axis of x, and hence 
the perpendicular on it from the origin makes an angle 
90° + ^. 

Also the length of this perpendicular is K. 



384 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The equation to the axis of the parabola is therefore 
X cos (90° + 6)+y sin (90° + 6) = K, 
i.e. —X sin + y cos = IC, 

i.e. ax^Py = Kj^TW=^-"^^ (6). 

Again, the vertex is the point in which the axis (6) 
meets the curve (2). 

We have therefore to solve (6) and (2), i.e. (6) and 

^ilT^+^^^+^-^2/ + '^ = o (7). 

The solution of (6) and (7) therefore gives the required 
coordinates of the vertex. 

361. It was proved in Art. 224 that if PK be a 
diameter of the parabola and Q V the ordinate to it drawn 
through any point Q of the curve, so that ^ F is parallel to 
the tangent at P, and if 6 be the angle between the diameter 
P V and the tangent at P, then 

^F2 = 4acosec2^.PF (1). 

If QL be perpendicular to P F and QL' be perpendicular 
to the tangent at P, we have 

QL^QVBm.e, and ^i:' = PFsin6i, 

so that (1) is QL^ - ia cosec . QL'. 

Hence the square of the perpendicular distance of any 
point Q on the parabola from any diameter varies as the 
perpendicular distance of Q from the tangent at the end of 
the diameter. 

Hence, if Ax + By + C — be the equation of any 
diameter and A'x + B'y + C — be the equation of the 
tangent at its end, the equation to the parabola is 

{Ax + By-hCf = X{A'x-\-B'y^C') (2), 

where X is some constant. 

Conversely, if the equation to a parabola can be reduced 
to the form (2), then 

Ax-\-By+G^O (3) 



TRACING OF PARABOLAS. 335 

is a diameter of the parabola and the axis of the parabola is 
parallel to (3). 

We shall apply this property in the following article. 

362. To trace the parabola given hy the general equa- 
tion of the second degree 

ax^+ ^hxy + hy"^ + 2gx + %fy + g=^ (1). 

Second Method. Since the curve is a parabola, the 
terms of the second degree must form a perfect square 
and A^ = ah. 

Put then a — a^ and h ~ /3^, so that h = ayS, and the 
equation (1) becomes 

{ax + ^yf = -{2gx + 2/y + c) (2). 

As in the last article the straight line ax + jSy = is a 
diameter, and the axis of the parabola is therefore parallel 
to it, and so its equation is of the form 

ax + /3y + \ = (3). 

The equation (2) may therefore be written 

{ax + l3y + Xy = -{2gx+ 2fy + c) + X^+2\ (ax + fy) 

= 2x{Xa-g) + 2y((3\-f) + X'-G (4). 

Choose A, so that the straight lines 

ax + /3y + \ = (5) 

and 2x{Xa-g) + 2y(j3X-f)+X^-G = (6) 

are at right angles, i.e. so that 

a{Xa-g) + pH3X-/) = 0, 

i.e. so that X= „ „ „ (7). 

a? + ^^ ^ ' 

The lines (5) and (6) are now, by the last article, a 
diameter and a tangent at its extremity ; also, since they 
are at right angles, they must be the axis and the tangent 
at the vertex. 



336 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The equation (4) may now, by (7), be written 



z e. 






where PiV is the perpendicular from any point F of the 
curve on the axis, and A is the vertex. 

Hence the axis and tangent at the vertex are the lines 
(5) and (6), where X. has the value (7), and the latus rectum

First Method. Take ^x-^y = as the new axis of x, i.e. turn 
the axes through an angle ^, where tan^ = |, and therefore sin^ = | 
and cos^=|. 

For X we therefore substitute Xcos^-Fsin^, i.e. — = ; for 

5 

3X + 4Y 
y we put Xsin^+Fcos^, i.e. = — , and hence for ^x-Ay the 

quantity -57. 

The equation (1) therefore becomes 

2572_i[72Z-54Y]-i[303Z+404r| + 19 = 0, 

i.e. 25r2-75Z-70r+19=0 (2). 

This is the equation to the curve referred to the axes OX and OY. 
But (2) can be written in the form 

147 
T 



r2_i_=3Z-^|, 



i.e. (7-^)2=3Z-i| + f|=3(Z+f). 



TRACING OF PARABOLAS. 



337 



Take a point A whose coordinates referred to OX and OY are -| 
and I, and draw AL and AM parallel to OX and OY respectively. 




lA 

Referred to AL and AM the equation to the parabola is Y^=SX. 
It is therefore a parabola, whose vertex is A, whose latua rectum is 3, 
and whose axis is AL. 

Second Metliod. The equation (1) can be written 

(3a;-4?/ + X)2=(6\ + 18)a; + ?/{101-8X) + X2-19 (3). 

Choose X so that the straight lines 

Sx-4y + \=0 
and (6X + 18)a; + y (101- 8X) + X2- 19 = 

may be at right angles. 
Hence X is given by 

3 (6X + 18) - 4 (101 - 8X) = (Art. 69), 
and therefore X = 7. 

The equation (3) then becomes 

(8a; -4:y + If = 15 {4.x + 3i/ + 2), 

(^^r--^^^ &lt;^)- 

Let AL be the straight line 

3a;-4^ + 7 = (5), 

and blithe straight line 4a; + 3z/ + 2 = (6). 

These are at right angles. 

If P be any point on the parabola and FN be perpendicular to 
AL, the equation (4) gives PN^=S . AN. 

Hence, as in the first method, we have the parabola. 

The vertex is found by solving (5) and (6) and is therefore the 
point (-If, ft). 

L. 22 



338 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

In drawing curves it is often advisable, as a verification, to find 
whether they cut the original axes of coordinates. 

Thus the points in which the given parabola cuts the axis of x 
are found by putting 2/ = in the original equation. The resulting 
equation is Occ^- 18a; + 19 = 0, which has imaginary roots. 

The parabola does not therefore meet Ox. 

Similarly it meets Oy in points given by 16?/2- 101i/ + 19 = 0, the 
roots of which are nearly %\ and y\. 

The values of OQ and OQ' should therefore be nearly ^^ and 6^. 

364. To find the direction and magnitude of the axes 
of the central conic section 

aQ(? + 2Axy + hy"^ =1 (1). 

First Method. We know that, when the equation to 
a central conic section has no term containing xy and the 
axes are rectangular, the axes of coordinates are the axes of 
the curve. 

Now in Art. 349 we shewed that, to get rid of the term 
involving xy^ we must turn the axes through an angle 6 
given by 

tan2^--^ (2). 

a — ^ ' 

The axes of the curve are therefore inclined to the axes 
of coordinates at an angle 6 given by (2). 
Now (2) can be written 

2 tan ^ _ 2A _ 1 
l-tan^^"^^6-X^'^^^' 

.-. tan2^ + 2A.tan(9-l =0 (3). 

This, being a quadratic equation, gives two values for ^, 
which differ by a right angle, since the product of the two 
values of tan ^ is — 1. Let these values be 6^ and 6^, which 
are therefore the inclinations of the required axes of the 
curve to the axis of x. 

Again, in polar coordinates, equation (1) may be written 
r"" (a cos2 e + 2h cos (9 sin ^ + 6 sin' $)=! = cos^ 6 + sin' (9, 
i.e. 

cos2(9 4-sin2^ 1+tan'^ 

^'' = _ — — — 

a cos^ + 2h cos sin $ + b sin^ a + 2h tan 6 + b tan^ 6 

(4).. 



AXES OF A CENTRAL CONIC SECTION. 839 

If in (4) we substitute either value of tan 6 derived 
from (3) we obtain the length of the corresponding 
semi-axis. 

The directions and magnitudes of the axes are therefore 
both found. 

Second Method. The directions of the axes of the 
conic are, as in the first method, given by 

tan 2^=.-^. 
a — 

When referred to the axes of the conic section as the 
axes of coordinates, let the equation become 

- + ■^-1 rm 

Since the equation (1) has become equation (5) by a 
change of axes without a change of origin, we have, by 
Art. 135, 

1 1 

-2 + ^2 = ^ + ^ (6), 

and -l^^ah-h' (7). 

arp-' 

These two equations easily determine the semi-axes a 
and /5. [For if from the square of (6) we subtract four 

times equation (7) we have (-^ — 02) , and hence —^— -^^'j 

1 In 

hence by (6) we get —^ and — . 

The difficulty of this method lies in the fact that we 
cannot always easily determine to which direction for an 
axis the value a belongs and to which the value yS. 

If the original axes be inchned at an angle w, the equa- 
tions (6) and (7) are, by Art. 137, 

1 1 a + h — 2h cos w 

, \ ah — // 

and ~¥7yi= - 2 '

340 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Cor. 1. The reciprocals of the squares of the semi- 
axes are, by (3) and (4), the roots of the equation 

2^ - {ci + h) Z + ah -h^ = 0. 
Cor. 2. From equation (4) we have 
Area of an ellipse = 7ra/5 =

365. Ex. 1. Trace the curve 

14a;2 - 4a;2/ + 112/2- 44a; -58i/ + 71 = (1). 

Since ( - 2)^ - 14 . 11 is negative, the curve is an ellipse. [Art. 358.] 
By Art. 352 the centre (S, y) of the curve is given by the equations 

145-2^-22=0, and -25 + 11^-29 = 0. 
Hence ic= 2, and ^=3. 

The equation referred to parallel axes through the centre is 
therefore l^x^ - ^xy + lly'^ + c' = 0, 

where c' = - 225 - 29^ + 71 = - 60, 

so that the equation is 

Ux^-4:xy + lly'^ = m (2). 

The directions of the axes are given by 

,. „„ 2h -4 

*"^2^=^36=i43ri=-- 

2tan^ . 

so that 



l-tan2^ ^' 
and hence 2 tan^ ^ - 3 tan - 2 = 0. 

Therefore tan ^i=2, and tan 6^= -\. 
Referred to polar coordinates the equation (2) is 

r2 (14 cos2 ^ - 4 cos ^ sin ^ + 11 sin^ d) = 60 (cos^ 9 + sin^ 0), 

l + tan2^ 



r''^ = 60

When tan ^1 = 2, »'i' = 60x ^^^^=6. 
When tan 6^=-^ r^^=GO x j^j:j:|^_ =4. 



TRACING A CENTRAL CONIC SECTION. 



341 



The lengths of the semi-axes are therefore fJ6 and 2. 

Hence, to draw the curve, 
take the point C, whose coordi- 
nates are (2, 3). 

Through it draw A'CA in- 
clined at an angle tan~i 2 to the 
axis of X and mark off 

A'C = GA=&gt;J6. 
Draw BCB' at right angles 
to AC A' and take B'G=CB=:2. 

The required ellipse has A A' 
and BB' as its axes. 

It would be found, as a veri- 
fication, that the curve does not meet the original axis of x, and 
that it meets the axis of y at distances from the origin equal to 
about 2 and 3 J respectively. 




Ex. 2. Trace the curve 

x'^~Bx2j + if + 10x-10y + 21 =

[Art. 358.] 



The centre {x, y) is given by 



- 3_ ^ ^ 



and —x + y -5 = 0, 

so that ^=-2, and ^ = 2. 

The equation to the curve, referred to parallel axes through the 
centre, is then 

a;2 - 3a;i/ + 2/2 + 5 ( - 2) - 5 X 2 + 21 = 0, 

i.e. x^-3xy + y^=-l (2). 

The direction of the axes is given by 

2h -3 



tan 20 =

a-b 1-1 

so that 20=90° or 270°, 

and hence 0^= 45° and 02=135°. 

The equation (2) in polar coordinates is 

r2 (cos2 0-3 cos sin + sin^ 0) = - (sin^ + cos^ 0), 
l + tan2

To construct the curve take the point G whose coordinates are - 2 
and 2. Through G draw a straight line AG A' inclined at 45° to the 
axis of X and mark off A'C=GA = J2. 

Also through A draw a straight line KAK' perpendicular to GA 
and take AK=^K'A = ^^. By Art. 315, GK and GK' are then the 
asymptotes. 

The curve is therefore a hyperbola whose centre is G, whose 
transverse axis is ^'^, and whose asymptotes are GK and GK'. 




On putting a;=0 it will he found that the curve meets the axis of 
y where y — Z or 7, and, on putting ?/ = 0, that it meets the axis of x 
where x= - 3 or - 7. 



Hence 



0*3=3, 0(9' = 7, Oi? = 3, and 0R' = 1. 



366. Tojind the eccentricity of the central conic section 

ax^-\- 2hxy ■\-hy'^= 1 (1). 

First, let 7i^ — ah be negative, so that the curve is 



ECCENTEICITY OF A CONIC SECTION. 343 

an ellipse, and let the equation to the ellipse, referred to 
its axes, be 

By the theory of Invariants (Art. 135) we have 

^^+|-^ = ^ + ^ (2), 

and a^^"''^"'^'' (^)' 

Also, if e be the eccentricity, we have, if a be &gt; ^,

Hence

This equation at once gives e^. 

Secondly^ let h- — ab be positive, so that the curve is 
a hyperbola, and let the equation referred to its principal 
axes be 

^ _ ^^ = 1 
so that in this case 

-2- o2 = ^* + ^'a^^-^2^2 = ^^-'^^' = -(^'-^^)• 
Hence a^ — B^ = — T^ r s-nd a^B^ = -r^ j ,

so that a^ + /3^ = + x/(a^ - ^J + 4a^/3^ ^ + h?-]l ^^'^ ' 



344 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

In this case, if e be the eccentricity, we have 

'"^- j:^^~a''^'~~ a + b ^^' 

This equation gives e^. 

In each case we see that e is a root of the equation

i.e. of the equation 

e^ {ab - h') + {{a-bY + ih'} (e^ - 1 ) - 0. 

367. To obtain the foci of the central conic 
aoi? + Ihxy + by^ — 1. 

Let the direction of the axes of the conic be obtained as 
in Art. 364, and let 6-^ be the inclination of the major axis 
in the case of the ellipse, and the transverse axis in the case 
of the hyperbola, to the axis of x. 

Let r/ be the square of the radius corresponding to ^i, 
and let r^ be the square of the radius corresponding to the 
perpendicular direction. [In the case of the hyperbola r^ 
will be a negative quantity.] 

The distance of the focus from the centre is ^jr^ — r^ 
(Arts. 247 and 295). One focus will therefore be the point 

(vri^ — T^ cos ^1 , Jr^ — r^ sin ^J, 

and the other will be 

(- sjr^ — ri cos 6^ , - Jr^ - r/ sin 6^).

The equation may be written in the form

i.e. {x^ + y/^^y +y^- «^) (^^ - fj^^y +y^- ^^) = O- 

The locus therefore consists of the two ellipses 

x^ + /ij2xy+y^-a^=0, and x^-fj2xy + y'^-a^=0. 

These ellipses are equal and their semi-axes would be found to be

The major axis of the first is inclined at an angle of 135° to the 
axis of X, and that of the second at an angle of 45°.

CHAPTER XVL 

THE GENERAL CONIC. 

370. In the present chapter we shall consider proper- 
ties of conic sections which are given by the general equation 
of the second degree, viz. 

aoi? + '2Jnxy + hy^ + Igx + ^fy + c = (1). 

For brevity, the left-hand side of this equation is often 
called ^ (tc, 3/), so that the general equation to a conic is 

^ (a;, y) = 0. 

Similarly, &lt;^(aj', y) denotes the value of the left-hand 
side of (1) when x and y are substituted for x and y. 

The equation (1) is often also written in the form aS'^O. 

371. On dividing by c, the equation (1) contains five 

independent constants - , - , - , - , and - . 

c G G G c 

To determine these five constants, we shall therefore 
require five conditions. Conversely, if five independent 
conditions be given, the constants can be determined. 
Only one conic, or, at any rate, only a finite number of 
conies, can be drawn to satisfy five independent conditions. 

372. To find the equation to the tangent at any foint 
{x\ y') of the conic section 

cf&gt; {x, y) = ax^ + 2hxy + hy"^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. . .(1). 

Let {x", y") be any other point on the conic. 



350 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

The equation to the straight line joining this point to 
(x\ y) is 

2/-2/' = |^(^-^') (2). 

Since both (ic', 3/') and (a?", 2/") lie on (1), we have 

aaj'2 + "Ihxy' + hy'^ + 2^cc' + 2/2/' + c - (3), 

and a£c"2 + 2^a;'y ' + hy'"" + 2^£c" + Ify" + c = (4). 

Hence, by subtraction, we have 

a {x^ - x'") + 2^ {x'y' - xy) + 5 {y"" - 3/"^; 

+ 2^(x'-a.") + 2/(2/'-2/'') = (5). 

But 

2 (o^y - x"y") = {x' + x") {y' - y") + {x' - x") {y' + y"\ 
so that (5) can be written in the form 
{^ - x") [a {x' + x") + h(y'+ y") + 2^] 

+ ky' - y") [h {^' + x") + h{y' + y") + 2/] = 0, 
y"-y' ^ a{x' + x") + h(y' + y") + 2g 
*■ ^' x" -x' k {x' + x") + b{y' + y") + 2/ " 

The equation to any secant is therefore 

y y~ h{x' + x") + h{y'+y") + 2f^ a:;...^ 
To obtain the equation to the tangent at {x', y'), we put 
x" = x' and y" = y' in this equation, and it becomes 

, ax + hy' + &lt;7 . ,, 

y-y =- -7-7 — 1^, — &gt; (^ - ^\

The required equation is therefore 
axx' + h (xy + x'y) +l&gt;yy' + g (x + x) + f (y + y') 

+ c = (7). 

Cor. 1. The equation (7) may be written down, from 
the general equation of the second degree, by substituting 
XX foi- a^, yy' for 3/^, xy' + xy for 2xy, x + od for 2a?, and 
y-vy iovly. (Cf. Art. 152.) 



THE GENEKAL CONIC. POLE AND POLAR. 351 

Cor. 2. If the conic pass through the origin we have 
c = 0, and then the tangent at the origin (where x =0 and 
y = 0) is gx +fy = 0, 

i. e. the equation to the tangent at the origin is obtained by 
equating to zero the terms of the lowest degree in the 
equation to the conic. 

373. The equation of the previous article may also be obtained 
as follows ; If {x', y') and {x", y") be two points on the conic section, 
the equation to the line joining them is 

a{x-xf){x-x") + hl{x-x'){y-y") + {x-x"){ij-y')] + h{y-y'){y-y") 

= ax^ + 2hxy + by^ + 2gx + 2fy + c (1). 

For the terms of the second degree on the two sides of (1) cancel, 
and the equation reduces to one of the first degree, thus representing 
a straight line. 

Also, since {x', y') lies on the curve, the equation is satisfied by 
putting x=x' and y=y'. 

Hence {x', y') is a point lying on (1). 

So {x'\ y") lies on (1). 

It therefore is the straight line joining them. 

Putting x" — x' and y" =y' we have, as the equation to the tangent 
at {x', y'), 

a{x- x'f + 27i {x - x') [y - if) + &amp; {y - y'f 

= ax^ + ^hxy + 'by'^ + 2gx + 2fy + c, 

i.e. 2axx' + 2}i {x'y + xy') + 2\)yy' + 2gx + 2fy + c 

= ax"^ + 2hx'y' + hy"^ 

— - 2gx' - 2fy' - c, since {x', y') lies on the conic. 

Hence the equation (7) of the last article. 

374. To find the condition that any straight line 

lx + my + n = (1), 

may touch the conic 

ax^ + 2hxy + by^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = (2). 

Substituting for y in (2) from (1), we have for the equation giving 
the abscissae of the points of intersection of (1) and (2), 

x^ {am? - 2hlm + hP) - 2x (hmn - bin - gm^ +flm) 

+ bn^-2fmn + cm^=0 (3). 

If (1) be a tangent, the values of x given by (3) must be equal. 

The condition for this is, (Art. 1,) 

{hmn - bin - gm^+fhrif={am? - 2hlm + bl^) {bn^ - 2fmn + cm^). 



352 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

On simplifying, we have, after division by iii^, 
p {jic -p) + m2 {ca - p2) + n^ [ah - li') + 2mn [gh - af) + 2wZ {lif - hg) 
+ 2lm{fg-ch) = 0. 

Ex. Find the equations to the tangents to the conic 

x^ + 4:xy + 3y^-5x-Gy + S = (1), 

ivhich are parallel to the straight line a; + 4i/ = 0. 
Tlie equation to any such tangent is 

a; + 4^ + c = (2), 

where c is to be determined. 

This straight line meets (1) in points given by 

3x2 _ 2x (5c + 28) + 3c2 + 24c + 48 = 0. 
The roots of this equation are equal, i.e. the line (2) is a tangent, 
if {2(5c + 28)}2 = 4. 3.(3c2 + 24c+48), i.e. if c=-5 or -8. 
The required tangents are therefore 

a; + 4?/-5 = 0, and x + iij -Q — 0. 

375. As in Arts. 214 and 274 it may be proved that 
the polar of {x\ y) with respect to ^ (cc, y) = is 

{ax' + hy -{■ g) X + {hx + by' +/) y + gx +/y' + c = 0. 

The form of the equation to a polar is therefore the 
same as that of a tangent. 

Just as in Art. 217 it may now be shewn that, if the 
polar of F passes through T, the polar of T passes through 
P. 

The chord of the conic which is bisected at {x\ y), 
being parallel to the polar of (x, y) [Arts. 221 and 280], 
has as equation 

{ax + hy +g){x- x) + {hx' + by +/){y — y) = 0. 

376. To find the equation to the diameter bisecting all 
chords parallel to the straight line y = mx. 

Any such chord is y = 7nx-&gt;rK (1). 

This meets the conic section 

ax^ + 2hxy + by"^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = 
in points whose abscissae are given by 

ax^ + ^hx {mx + K) + b {mx + Kf + 2gx + 2f{mx + K)+ g=^0, 
i. e. by x^ {a + 2hm + bm^) + 2x {hK + bmK + ^ + fm) 

+ blO + 2fK-\-c = 0. 



THE GENERAL CONIC. CONJUGATE DIAMETERS. 353 

If fl?i and x^ be the roots of this equation, we therefore 
have 

X ^x - cy{ h + hm)K + g+fm 
^ ^ a + 2hm + bm^ 

Let {X, Y) be the middle point of the required chord, 
so that 

„ X1 + X2 (h + bm) K+ gf+/7n , . 

2 a + 2hm + b7)iF ' ^ ^' 

Also, since (X, Y) lies on (1) we have 

Y-^mX+K (3). 

If between (2) and (3) we eliminate K we have a 
relation between X and Y. 

This relation is 

— (a + 2hm + bm^) X = (h + bm) {Y — mX) + g +fm, 
i. e. X [a + hm) + Yih+ bm) + g -¥fm = 0. 

The locus of the required middle point is therefore the 
straight line whose equation is 

x{a + hm) + y(h + bm) + g ■\-fm == 0. 

If this be parallel to the straight line y - m'x, we 
have 

a + Am 



m = 



•w, 



h + bm 

i.e. a + h (m + m') + bmm' = (5). 

This is therefore the condition that the two straight 
lines y — tnx and y — m!x may be parallel to conjugate 
diameters of the conic given by the general equation. 

377. To find the condition that the pair of straight lines, whose 
equation is 

Ax'^ + 2Hxy+By^=0 (1), 

may be parallel to conjugate diameters of the general conic 

ax'^ + 2hxy + by^ + 2gx + 2fy + c = .'. (2). 

Let the equations of the straight lines represented by (1) hey = mx 
and y = m'x, so that (1) is equivalent to 

B [y - mx) [y - m'x) = 0, 

and hence m-\-m'= --—, and mm =^ . 

L. 23 



354 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

By the condition of the last article it therefore follows that the 
lines (1) are parallel to conjugate diameters if 

i.e. if Ah-2Hh + Ba = 0. 

378. To prove that tioo concentric conic sections always have a 
pair, and only one pair, of common conjugate diameters and to find 
their equation. 

Let the two concentric conic sections be 

ax^ + 2hxy + hy'^=l (1), 

and a'x^^-2h'xy + l)Y = l (2). 

The straight lines 

Ax^ + 2Hxy + By^ = (3), 

are conjugate diameters of both (1) and (2) if 

Ab-2Hh + Ba = 0, 
and Ab'-2Hh' + Ba' = 0. 

Solving these two equations we have 

A -2H__ B 

ha' - h'a ~ W^afb ~ hh' - b'h ' 

Substituting these values in (3), we see that the straight lines 

x^ha'-h'a)-xy{ab'-a'b)4-y^{bh'-b'h) = (4) 

are always conjugate diameters of both (1) and (2). 

Hence there is always a pair of conjugate diameters, real, coinci- 
dent, or imaginary, which are common to any two concentric conic 
sections.

379. Two conies, in general, intersect in four points,

and a'x^ + 2x (Ky + g) + 6^' + %f'y + C - 0. 

23—2 



356 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Eliminating x from these equations, we find that the 
result is an equation of the fourth degree in y, giving 
therefore four values, real or imaginary, for y. Also, by 
eliminating x^ from these two equations, we see that there 
is only one value of x for each value of y. There are there- 
fore only four points of intersection. 

380. Equation to any conic passing through the inter- 
section of two given conies. 

Let S^ ax"" + 2hxy + hy"" + 2gx + ^fy + c = (1), 

and S' E ax" + 2h'xy + h'y^ + 2g'x + If'y + c' = . . . (2) 

be the equations to the two given conies. 

Then ^-_X.S" = (3) 

is the equation to any conic passing through the inter- 
sections of (1) and (2). 

For, since S and aS^' are both of the second degree in x 
and 2/, the equation (3) is of the second degree, and hence 
represents a conic section. 

Also, since (3) is satisfied when both ^S' and S' are zero, 
it is satisfied by the points (real or imaginary) which are 
common to (1) and (2). 

Hence (3) is a conic which passes through the intersec- 
tions of (1) and (2). 

381. To find the equations to the straight lines passing 
through the intersections of two conies given hy the general 
equations. 

As in the last article, the equation 

{a - \a) 0^2 + 2 (A - Xh') xy + (h - \h') ^ + 2 (^ - Xg') x 

+ 2(f-\r)y + {c-Xc') = (1), 

represents some conic through 4}he intersections of the given 
conies. 

Now, by Art. 116, (1) represents straight lines if 
{a - \a') (b - Kb') (c - Xc') + 2 (f - Xf) (g - Xg') (h - Xh') 
-{a- Xa') (/- Xf'f -{b- Xb') (g - Xg'f - (c - Xc') (h - XhJ 

= (2). 



INTERSECTIONS OF TWO CONIGS. 357 

Now (2) is a cubic equation. The thi-ee values of \ 
found from it will, when substituted successively in (1), 
give the three pairs of straight lines which can be drawn 
through the (real or imaginary) intersections of the two 
conies. 

Also, since a cubic equation always has one real root, 
one value of A. is real, and it could be shown that there can 
always be drawn one pair of real straight lines through the 
intersections of two conies. 

382. All conies tvhich pass through the intersections of 
two rectangular hyperbolas are themselves rectangular hyper- 
bolas. 

In this case, \i S = and S' — be the two rectangular 
hyperbolas, we have 

« + 6 = 0, and a +b' = 0. (Art. 358.) 

Hence, in the conic S — X;S" — 0, the sum of the co- 
efficients of x^ and y"^ 

= (a- Xa') + {b- Xb') =:(a + b)-X{a' + b') - 0. 

Hence, the conic S ~ XS' ^ 0, i.e. any conic through the 
intersections of the two rectangular hyperbolas, is itself a 
rectangular hyperbola. 

Cor. If two rectangular hyperbolas intersect in four points 
A, B, G, and D, the two straight lines AD and BC, which are a conic 
through the intersection of the two hyperbolas, must be a rectangular 
hyperbola. Hence AD and BC must be at right angles. Similarly, 
BD and GA, and GD and AB, must be at right angles. Hence D is 
the orthocentre of the triangle ABG. 

Therefore, if two rectangular hyperbolas intersect in four points, 
each point is the orthocentre of the triangle formed by the other 
three. 

383. 7/* Z = 0, i/== 0, ^= 0, and 11 = be the equations 
to the four sides of a quadrilateral taken in order, the 
equation to any conic passing through its angular points is 

LN=X.MR (1). 

For L = passes through one pair of its angular points 
and N=0 passes through the other pair. Hence LN = is 
the equation to a conic (viz. a pair of straight lines) passing 
through the four angular points. 



358 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Similarly MR - is the equation to another conic 
passing through the four points. 

Hence LN = X . MR is the equation to any conic through 
the four points. 

Geometrical meaning. Since L is proportional to the perpen- 
dicular from any point {x, y) upon the straight line Z/ = 0, the 
relation (1) states that the product of the perpendiculars from any 
point of the curve upon the straight lines JL = and N=0 is propor- 
tional to the product of the perpendiculars from the same point upon 
i!I=0 and E = 0. 

Hence If a conic circumscribe a quadrilateral^ the ratio of the 
p7'oduct of the perpendiculars from any point P of the conic upon two 
opposite sides of the quadrilateral to the product of the perpendiculars 
from P upon the other tioo sides is the same for all positions of P. 

384. Equations to the conic sections passing through 
the intersections of a conic and two 
given straight lines. 

Let *S' = be the equation to the 
given conic. 

Let u-0 and v = be the equa- 
tions to the two given straight lines 
where 

u = ax + hy ■\- Cj 

and V = ax + Vy -f- c' . 

Let the straight line ^^ = meet the conic /S' = in the 
points P and P, and let v = meet it in the points Q and T. 

The equation to any conic which passes through the 
points P, Q^ R, and T will be of the form 

S^X.u.v (1). 

For (1) is satisfied by the coordinates of any point 
which lies both on S — and on u-O] for its coordinates 
on being substituted in (1) make both its members zero. 

But the points P and R are the only points which lie 
both on S — and on u = 0. 

The equation (1) therefore denotes a conic passing 
through P and R. 

Similarly it goes through the intersections of ^S' = and 
-y = 0, i. e. through the points Q and T. 




THE EQUATION S=XuV. 359 

Thus (1) represents some conic going through the four 
points P, Q, B, and T. 

Also (1) represents any conic going through these four 
points. For the quantity A. may be so chosen that it shall 
go through any fifth point, or to make it satisfy any fifth 
condition* also five conditions completely determine a conic 
section. 

"Ex.. Find the equation to the conic which passes through the point 
(1, 1) and also through the intersections of the conic 

tvith the straight lines 2x-y - 5 = and Bx + y -11 = 0. Find also 
the paradolas passing through the same points. 

The equation to the required conic must by the last article be of 
the form 

x^ + 2xy + 5y^-7x-8y + Q = X {2x -y - 5) {Sx + y -11) ... {1). 
This passes through the point (1, 1) if 

l + 2 + 5-7-8 + 6=X{2-l-5) (3 + 1-11), i.e. i{ \=-^\. 
The required equation then becomes 
28{x^+2xy + 5y^-7x-8y + 6) + {2x-y-5) {3x + y -11) = 0, 
i.e. 34x2 + 55xy + l'62if - 233a; - 218y + 223 = 0. 

The equation to the required parabola will also be of the form (1), 
i.e. 
x^{l-Q\)+xy{2 + \)+if{5 + \)-x{7-SU)-y{8 + 6\) + Q-55\ = 0. 
This is a parabola (Art. 357) if (2 + X)2 = 4 (1 - 6X) (5 + X), 
I.e. if X=|[-12±4V101. 

Substituting these values in (1), we have the required equations. 

385. Particular cases of the equation 

S = Xuv. 

I. Let ^t = and v = intersect on the curve, i.e. in 
the figure of Art. 384 let the 

points P and Q coincide. 

The conic S = Xuv then goes 
through two coincident points 
at P and therefore touches the 
original conic at P as in the 
figure. 

II. Let ^6 = and v = 
coincide, so that v = u. 




360 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 




In this case the point T also moves up to coincidence 
with R and the second conic 

touches the original conic at both ^^--''" ~^ \ 

the points P and B,. 

The equation to the second 
conic now becomes S=\v?. 

When a conic touches a second 
conic at each of two points, the 
two conies are said to have double 
contact with one another. 

The two conies S = \v? and /S' = therefore have double 
contact with one another, the straight line 16 = passing 
through the two points of contact. 

As a particular case we see that if ?// — 0, v - 0, and 
^f; = be the equations to three straight lines then the 
equation vw = \v? represents a conic touching the conic 
'DW = where u = meets it, i. e. it is a conic to which 
v = and w 
contact. 



are tangents and .u = is the chord of 



tl=rO 



III. Let u = be a tangent to the original conic. 

In this case the two points P 
and P coincide, and the conic 
S=-Xuv touches S=0 where u=0 
touches it, and v = is the equa- 
tion to the straight line joining 
the other points of intersection of 
the two conies. 

If, in addition, v — goes 
through the point of contact of w = 0, we have the equation 
to a conic which goes through three coincident points at P, 
the point of contact of u = ; also the straight line 
joining P to the other point of intersection of the two 
conies is v = 0. 




IV. Finally, let v = and u = coincide and be 
tangents at P. The equation S = Xu^ now represents a 
conic section passing through four coincident points at the 
point where u-0 touches S = 0. 



LINE AT INFINITY. 861 

386. Line at infinity. We have shewn, in Art. 
60, that the straight line, whose equation is 

().x + 0.y + G = 0, 

is altogether at an infinite distance. This straight line is 
called The Line at Infinity. Its equation may for brevity 
be written in the form C = 0. 

We can shew that parallel lines meet on the line at 
infinity. 

For the equations to any two parallel straight lines 
are 

Ax + By + C =0 (1), 

and Ax + By+G' = (2). 

Now (2) may be written in the form 

Ax + By + C + ^ ~^ (0 . a; + . 3/ + (7) = 0, 

and hence, by Art. 97, we see that it passes through the 
intersection of (1) and the straight line 

0.x + 0.y + C = 0. 

Hence (1), (2), and the line at infinity meet in a point. 

387. Geometrical rtieaning of the equation 

S=Xu (1), 

where X is a constant^ ayid u = is the equation of a straight 
line. 

The equation (1) can be written in the form 

/S' = Xz* X (0 . £c + . 2/ + 1), 

and hence, by Art. 384, represents a conic passing through 
the intersection of the conic S—^ with the straight lines 

u = ^ and 0.£c + 0.2/ + l = 0. 

Hence (1) passes through the intersection of aS'=0 with 
the line at infinity. 

Since aS' = and S = \u have the same intersections with 



362 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

the line at infinity, it follows that these two conies have 
their asjTiiptotes in the same direction. 

Particular Case. Let 

S = x^ + y^ — a^, 

so that S = represents a circle. 

Any other circle is 

x^ + y^- 2gx — 2 ft/ + c = 0, 

i.e. x^ + y^ — a^=2gx+2f'i/ — a^ — c, 

so that its equation is of the form *S' = Xil 

It therefore follows that any two circles must be looked 
upon as intersecting the line at infinity in the same two 
(imaginary) points. These imaginary points are called the 
Circular Points at Infinity. 

388. Geometrical meaning of the equation S = \ where 
\ is a constant. 

This equation can be written in the form 

S^\{0.x + 0.y+lY, 

and therefore, by Art. 385, has double contact with S = 
where the straight line .x + Q .y +1 =0 meets it, i.e. the 
tangents to the two conies at the points where they meet 
the line at infinity are the same. 

The conies S=0 and S — X therefore have the same 
(real or imaginary) asymptotes. 

Particular Case. Let S -=^0 denote a circle. Then 
S — X (being an equation which differs from S —0 only in 
its constant term) represents a concentric circle. 

Two concentric circles must therefore be looked upon as 
touching one another at the imaginary points where they 
meet the Line at Infinity. 

Two concentric circles thus have double contact at the 
Circular Points at Infinity.

section which touches the given conic at P and R and 
which also goes through the point T. 

Also we can only draw one conic to go through five 
points, viz. T^ two points at P, and two points at R. 

If then we find X so that (1) goes through the point T^ 
it must represent the two tangents TP and TR. 

The equation (1) is satisfied by od and y' if

i.e. if ^'=-irr'&gt; — ^\- 

The required equation (1) then becomes 
^ (x, y) [ax^ + 2hxy + by^ + 2gx + 2fy -f c] 

= [(ax + hy' +g)x+ {hx +hy' -\-f)y + gx +fy' + cf, 
i.e. ^ (x, y) X ^ (x', y) = u2, 

where tt = is the equation to the chord of contact. 

390. Director circle of a conic given hy the general 
equation of the second degree. 

The equation to the two tangents from {x ^ y) to the 
conic are, by the last article, 

^f? \a^ [x', y') — (ax + hy' + gY] 
+ 2xy [hcj) (x, y') - (ax' + hy + g) (hx + by' +/)] 
+ 2/' [b4&gt; (x, y) - (hx + by' +fY\ + other terms = 0...(1). 
If (x', y') be a point on the director circle of the conic, 
the two tangents from it to the conic are at right angles. 

Now (1) represents two straight lines at right angles if 
the sum of the coefficients of x^ and y^ in it be zero, 
i.e. if (a + b)&lt;t&gt; (x',y') - (ax + hy' + gf - (hx' + by' +ff = 0. 
Hence the locus of the point (x', y) is 
(a + b) (ax^ + 2hxy + by^ + 2gx + 2fy + c) 

— (ax + hy + gf — (hx + by +fY — 0, 
i.e. the circle whose equation is 

(x' + f) (ab - A^) + 2x (bg -fh) + 2y (af- gh) 



366 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Cor. If the given conic be a parabola, then ah = h^, 
and the locus becomes a straight line, viz. the directrix of 
the parabola. (Art. 211.) 

391. The equation to the director circle may also be obtained in 
another manner. For it is a circle, whose centre is at the centre of 
the conic, and the square of whose radius is equal to the sum of the 
squares of the semi-axes of the conic. 

The centre is, Art. 352, the point (%^^ , ^^'H ) . 

\ab - Ir ab - h^J 

Also, if the equation to the conic be reduced to the form 
ax^ + 2hxy + hy^ + c' = 0, 
and if a and /3 be its semi-axes, we have, (Art. 364,) 
i l-^il^ A 1 _ ah-li'^

392. The equation to the (imaginary) tangents drawn 
from the focus of a conic to touch the conic satisfies the 
analytical condition for being a circle. 

Take the focus of the conic as origin, and let the axis of 
X be perpendicular to its directrix, so that the equation to 
the latter may be written in the form x-{-h = 0. 

The equation to the conic, e being its eccentricity, is 
therefore x^ + y^= e^ {x + ky, 

i.e. jK2(l-e2) + 2/2-2e'^x-e2P^0. 

The equation to the pair of tangents drawn from the 
origin is therefore, by Art. 389, 

[x^ (1 - e^) + 2^2 _ 2e%x - e^P] [- e'k'''] = [- e^kx - e'^JcJ, 

i.e. a^ (1 — e^) + 2/^ — 2e^kx — e^k^ - — e^[x + k]^, 

i.e. x' + y^ = (1). 

Here the coefficients of x^ and y"^ are equal and the 
coefficient of xy is zero. 



FOCI OF THE GENERAL CONIC. 367 

However the axes and origin of coordinates be changed, 
it follows, on making the substitutions of Art. 129, that in 
(1) the coefficients of o(? and y"^ will still be equal and the 
coefficient of xy zero. 

Hence, whatever be the conic and however its equation 
may be written, the equation to the tangents from the focus 
always satisfies the analytical conditions for being a circle. 

393. To find the foci of the conic given hy the general 
equation of the second degree 

ax^ + ^hxy + hy'^ + "Igx + ^fy + c = 0. 

Let (aj', 2/') be a focus. By the last article the equation 
to the pair of tangents drawn from'it satisfies the conditions 
for being a circle. 

The equation to the pair of tangents is 
^ (^', y) [«^ + ^hxy + hy'^ + Igx + Ify + c] 

= \x {ax' + hy' + g) + y (hx' + by' +/) + (gx' +fy + c)]^. 

In this equation the coefficients of xF and y^ must be 
equal and the coefficient of xy must be zero. 

We therefore have 
acf&gt; (x\ y') — (ax + hy' + gY = hcf&gt; (x', y) — {lix + hy +y* )^, 
and 7i0 (a?', y'^ = (ax' + hy' + g) (Jix + by' +f), 

i.e. 

{ax' + hy' + gf - {hx + by' +ff _ {ax' + hy' + g) {hx' + by' +/) 
a — b h 

= &lt;!&gt;¥,&amp;;) ■••••w- 

These equations, on being solved, give the foci. 

Cor. Since the directrices are the polars of the foci, 
we easily obtain their equations. 

394. The equations (4) of the previous article give, in general, 
four values for x' and four corresponding values for y'. Two of these 
would be found to be real and two imaginary. 

In the case of the ellipse the two imaginary foci lie on the minor 
axis. That these imaginary foci exist follows from Art. 247, by 
writing the standard equation in the form 



368 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

This shews that the imaginary point {0, sj^^-o^] is a focus, the 
imaginary line y . =0 is a directrix, and that the correspond- 



ing eccentricity is the imaginary quantity 



/&amp;2_a2 



Similarly for the hyperbola, except that, in this case, the eccen- 
tricity is real. 

In the ease of the parabola, two of the foci are at infinity and are 
imaginary, whilst a third is at infinity and is real. 

395. Ex. 1. Find the focus of the parabola 

16a;2 - 2ixy + %2 - 80a; - 140?/ -1- 100=0. 
The focus is given by the equations 
{IQx' - 1 2y' - 40)^ - ( - 12a;^ + 9y' - 70 )^ 

rj 

_ {16x' - 12y ^ - 40) ( - 12a;^ + 9y' - 70) 
~ -12 

= lQx'^-24:xY + 9y'^-80x'-U0y' + 100 (1). 

The first pair of equation (1) give 

12 (16a;' - 12y' - 40)2 + 7 (ig^/ _ i2y' _ 40) ( - 12a;' + 9i/ - 70) 

-12 (-12a;' -1-9?/' -70)2=0, 

i.e. {4 (16a;' - 12y' - 40) - 3 ( - 12a;' + 9y' - 70)} 

X { 3 (16a;' - 12^/' - 40) 4- 4 ( - 12ic' -h %' - 70) } = 0, 

i.e. (100a;'-75?/' + 50)x(-400) = 0, 

so that y = — ^ — . 

We then have 16a;' - 12^' - 40 = - 48, 

and - 12a;' -[-V- 70 =-64. 

The second pair of equation (1) then gives 

48 X 64 
_ ^ox»^ ^ ^, ^^g^, _ ^2^, _ 40) + 2/' ( - 12a;' + 9?/' - 70) - 40a;' - 70^' + 100 

= - 48a;' - 64?/' - 40a;' - 70?/' + 100 

= - 88a;' -134?/'-}- 100, 

^^n 00 , 536a;' -I- 268 ,^^ 

i.e. -256= -88a;' ~- -t-100, 

o 

so that a;' =1, and then 2/' =2. 

The focua is therefore the point (1, 2). 



AXES OF THE GENERAL CONIC. 369 

In the case of a parabola, we may also find the equation to the 
directrix, by Art. 390, and then find the coordinates of the focus, 
which is the pole of the directrix. 

Ex. 2. Find the foci of the conic 

55a;2 - SOxy + 39^2 - 40a; - 24^/ - 464=0. 
The foci are given by the equation 
(55a;^ - 15y' - 20)^ - ( - 15a;^ + S9t/ - 12)2 
16 

_ {55c(/ - 15y' - 20) ( - 15x' + 39?/^ - 12) 
-15 

= 55a;'2 - 30a;y + 39?/'2 - 40a;' - 24^/' - 464 (1). 

The first pair of equations (1) gives 
15 (55a;' - 15^' - 20)2 + ig (55^/ _ 15^' _ 20) ( - 15a;' + 39?/' - 12) 

- 15 ( - 15a;' + S9y' - 12)2 ^ q, 
i.e. {5 (55a;' - 15y' - 20) - 3 ( - 15a;' + 39^' - 12) } 

{3 (55a;' - 15?/' - 20) + 5 ( - 15a;' + 39?/' - 12)} = 0, 
i.e. (5a;'-3?/'-l)(3a;' + 5?/'-4) = 0. 

, 5a;' - 1 
••• ^--3" (2)' 

3a;' -4 
or y'= — 5-- (3). 

Substituting this first value of y in the second pair of equation (1), 
we obtain 

o/;/o / 1X2 340a;'2- 340a;' -1355 
- 25 (2a;' - 1)2= , 

giving a;' = 2 or - 1, Hence from (2) y' — B or - 2. 

On substituting the second value of y' in the same pair of equation 
(1), we finally have 

2a;'2-2a;' + 13 = 0, 
the roots of which are imaginary. 

We should thus obtain two imaginary foci which would be found 
to lie on the minor axis of the conic section. The real foci are 
therefore the points (2, 3) and ( - 1, - 2). 

396. Equation to the axes of the general 
conic. 

By Art. 393, the equation 
(ax + hy + gf — (hx + by +fy _ {ax ■\-hy-\-g) {hx + hy +/) 
a — b h 

(1) 

represents some conic passing through the foci.

But, since it could be solved as a quadratic equation to 

ax + hy + a . ^ ^ ^ . i , t 

give 7 j^ — ^, it represents two straight lines.

The equation (1) therefore represents the axes of the 
general conic. 

397. To find the length of the straight lines drawn 
through a given point in a given direction to vieet a given 
conic. 

Let the equation to the conic be 

&lt;^ (aj, y) = ax^ + 2hxy + hy- + 2gx + Ify + c = . . .(1). 

Let F be any point (a;', y')^ and through it let there be 
drawn a straight line at an angle Q 
with the axis of x to meet the 
curve in Q and Q'. 

The coordinates of any point 
on this line distant r from P 
are 

£c^ + r cos Q and y' + r sin 0. 

(Art. 86.) 

If this point be on (1), we 
have 

a{x' + r cos &amp;f + 2A {x + r cos 0) [y' + r sin 0) + b (y' + r sin 0)^ 
+ 2g {x + r cos 0) + 2/ {y + r sin ^) + c = 0, 
i.e. 

r^ [a cos2 e + 2h cos ^ sin 6* + &amp; sin^ 0] 
+ 2r [(ax + hy' + g) cos d + {hx + by +/) sin ^] + &lt;^ (a;', 3/') = 

^ ;-(2). 

For any given value of this is a quadratic equation in 
r, and therefore for any straight line drawn at an inclina- 
tion it gives the values of FQ and PQ'. 

If the two values of r given by equation (2) be of 
opposite sign, the points Q and Q' lie on opposite sides 
of P. 

If P be on the curve, then &lt;f) (x, y) is zero and one value 
of T obtained from (2) is zero.

398. If two chords PQQ' and PRR' he drawn in given 
directions through any pohit P to meet the curve in Q, Q' and 
R^ R' respectively, the ratio of the rectangle PQ . PQ' to the 
rectangle PR . PR' is the same for all points, o^nd is therefore 
equal to the ratio of the squares of the diameters of the conic 
which are drawn in the given directions. 

The values of PQ and PQ' are given by the equation of 
the last article, and therefore 

PQ . PQ' = product of the roots 

^ ^ {^\ y) /jx 

a cos^ 6 + 2h cos sin ^ + 6 sin^ 6'"^ '' 
So, if PRR' be drawn at an angle &amp; to the axis, we have 

PR pp'= 9 {^^ y) /o\ 

a cos^ 0' + 2A cos 0' sin 6' -\-h sin^ 0'"'^ ^' 
On dividing (1) by (2), we have 

PQ . PQ' _ a cos^ 6' + 2h cos 0' sin 0' + 1} sin^ 6' 
PR . PR' ~ a cos^ e-\-2h cos ^ sin ^ + 6 sin^ 6 ' 

The right-hand member of this equation does not contain 
x' or y', i. e. it does not depend on the position of P but only 
on the directions and $\ 

The quantity ^ ' p&gt; is therefore the same for all 

positions of P. 

In the particular case when P is at the centre of the 

CO'"^ 
conic this ratio becomes ,^ ■, , where C is the centre and CQ' 

OR 

and CR" are parallel to the two given directions. 

Cor. If Q and Q' coincide, and also R and R', the two 
lines PQQ' and PRR become the tangents from P, and the 
above relation then gives 

PQ^C(r' . PQ _ CQ" 
PR' ~ OR'"' ' ""• ^' PR ~ CR" ■ 

Hence, If two tangents be drawn from a point to a conic, 
their lengths are to one another in the ratio of the parallel 
semi-diameters of the conic.

400. If a circle and a conic section cut one another in four 'points, 
the straight line joining one pair of points of intersection and the 
straight line joining the other pair are equally inclined to the axis of 
the conic. 

For (Fig. Art. 397) let the circle and conic intersect in the four 
points Q, Q' and B, B' and let QQ' and RB' meet in P. 

But, since Q, Q', B, and B' are four points on a circle, we have 
PQ . PQ' = PB . PB'. [Euc. III. 36, Cor.] 
.-. CQ" = CB". 
Also in any conic equal radii from the centre are equally inclined

Hence GQ" and CB", and therefore PQQ' and PBB\ are equally 
inclined to the axis of the conic. 

401. To shew that any chord of a conic is cut har-

But (2) is the polar of the origin with respect to the

402. To find the locus of the middle points of 'parallel cliords of a 
conic. [Cf. Art. 376.] 

The lengths of the segments of the chord drawn through the point 
{x\ y') at an angle 6 to the axis of x is given by equation (2) of Art. 
397. 

If {x', y') be the middle point of the chord the roots of this 
equation are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, so that their 
algebraic sum is zero. 

The coefi&amp;cient of r in this equation is therefore zero, so that 
{ax' + hy' + g) cos + [hx' + by' +/) sin ^ = 0. 

The locus of the middle point of chords inclined at an angle 6 to 
the axis of x is therefore the straight line 

(ax + hy + g) + {hx + by +f) tan ^ = 0. 
Hence the locus of the middle points of chords parallel to the line 
y = mx is 

{ax + hy +g) + {hx + by+f) m = 0, 

i.e. x{a + hm) + {h + bm) y + g +fm = 0. 

This is parallel to the line y = m'x if 

, a + hm 
m = -J- — ^ , 
h + bm 

i.e. if a + h{m + m') + bmm' = 0. 

This is therefore the condition that y = mx and y — m'x should be 
parallel to conjugate diameters.

403. Equation to the pair of tangents drawn from a given point 
{x', y') to a given conic, [Cf. Art. 389.] 

If a straight line be drawn through [x', y'), the point P, to meet 
the conic in Q and Q\ the lengths of PQ and PQ' are given by the 
equation 

r2 (a cos^ ^ + 2/4 cos ^ sin ^ + 6 sin^ 6) 

+ 2r l{ax' + hy' + g) cos 6 + {hx' + 5?/' +/) sin ^] + (x', ?/') = 0. 

The roots of this equation are equal, i.e. the corresponding Hnes 
touch the conic, if 

{a cos2 ^ + 2/i cos ^ sin ^ + &amp; sin^ ^) x &lt;^ {x', y') 

= [{ax' + hy' + £f) cos 6 + {hx' + by'+f) sin ^p, 

I.e. if (a + 27i tan ^ + &amp; tan^ ^) x (a;', y') 

= [{ax' + hy' + g) + {hx' + by'+f) tan ef...{l). 

The roots of this equation give the corresponding directions of the 
tangents through P. 

Also the equation to the line through P inclined at an angle 6 to 
the axis of x is 

^^ = tan0 (2).

If we substitute for tan 6 in (1) from (2) we shall get the equation

tions of the chord. 

22- Obtain the equations for the foci also from the fact that the 
product of the perpendiculars drawn from them upon any tangent is 
the same for all tangents. 

404. To find the equation to a conic, the axes of co- 
ordinates being a tangent and normal to the conic. 

Since the origin is on the curve, the equation to the 
curve must be satisfied by the coordinates (0, 0) so that the 
equation has no constant term and therefore is of the form 
ax^ + 2hxy + h'lf + 2gx + yy — 0. 

If this curve touch the axis of x at the orio-in, then, 
when 2/ = 0, we must have a perfect square and therefore 

The required equation is therefore 

ax^ + Ihxy + hy"^ + 2/^/ = (1). 

Ex. O is any point on a conic and PQ a chord ; prove that 
(1) if PQ subtend a right angle at O, it passes through a fixed 
point on the normal at O, and 



378 



COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 



(2) if OP and OQ be equally inclined to the normal at 0, then 
PQ passes through a fixed point on the tangent at 0. 

Take the tangent and normal at as axes, so that the equation to 
the conic is (1). 

Let the equation to PQ be y = mx + c (2). 

Then, by Art. 122, the equation to the lines OP and OQ is 

c {ax'^ + 2hxy + by^) + 2fy {y -mx) = (3). 

(1) If the lines OP and OQ be at right angles then (Art. 66), we 
have ac + bc + 2/= 0, 



I.e. 



a + b 



= a constant for all positions of PQ. 

But c is the intercept of PQ on the axis of y, i.e. on the normal 
at 0. 

The straight line PQ therefore passes through a fixed point on the 

— 2/ 

normal at which is distant v from O. 

a + b 

This point is often called the Fregier Point. 

(2) If again OP and OQ be equally inclined to the axis of y then, 
in equation (3), the coefficient of xy must be zero, and hence 

2;ic-2/m = 0,

But — is the intercept on the axis of x of the line PQ.

Hence, in this case, PQ passes through a fixed point on the tangent 
at 0.

407. Only one conic can he drawn through any Jive 
points. 

For the general equation to a conic through four points 
is (1) of Art. 405. 

If we wish it to pass through a fifth point, we substitute 
the coordinates of this fifth point in this equation, and thus 
obtain the corresponding value of h. Except when three of 
the five points lie on a straight line a value of h will always 
be found, and only one. 

Ex. Find the equation to the conic section which passes through 
the five points A, B, C, D, and E, whose coordinates are (1, 2), (3, —4), 
(-1, 3), (-2, -S),and{5, 6). 

The equations to AB, BC, CD, and DA are easily found to be 

y + 3x-5 = 0, 4:y + 7x-5 = 0, 6x-y + 9 = 0, and 5x-Sy + l = 0. 

The equation to any conic through the four points A, B, C, and D 
is therefore 

{y + Sx-5){6x-y + 9) = \{4:y + 7x-5){5x-3y + l) (1). 

If this conic pass through the point E, the equation (1) must be 
satisfied by the values x = 5 and y = &amp;. 

We thus have X = V- ^^^i on substitution in (1), the required 
equation is 

223a;2 - 38xy - 123?/ - 171a; + 8Sy + 350 = 0, 

which represents a hyperbola. 

4:03. To find the general equation to a conic section 
which touches four given straight lines, i.e. which is inscribed 
in a given quadrilateral. 




THE CONIC LM = R~. 381 

Let the four straight lines form the sides of the quadri- 
lateral ABCD. Let BA and CD meet in 0, and take OAB 
and ODC as the axes of x and y, and let the equations to 
the other two sides BG and DA be 

l-^x + 7n^y -1=0, and l^x + m^y -1 = 0. 

Let the equation to the straight line joining the points 
of contact of any conic touching the axes at P and Q be 

ax + hy —1 = 0. 

By Art. 385, II, the equation to the conic is then 

2Xxy = (ax + hy — Vf (1). 

The condition that the straight line BG should touch 
this conic is, as in Art. 374, found to be 

A. = 2(a-Zi)(6-mi) (2). 

Similarly, it will be touched by AD if 

X = 2{a-l){h-m^) (3). 

The required conic has therefore (1) as its equation, the 
values of a and h being given in terms of the quantity A. by 
means of (2) and (3). 

Also X is any quantity we may choose. Hence we have 
the system of conies touching the four given lines. 

If we solve (2) and (3), we obtain 

2&amp; - (mi + W2 ) _ _ 2a-(Zi + y _ ^ / -^ 2\

409. The conic LM=R", where L = 0, M=0, and 
R — are the equations of straight lines. 

The equation LM=0 represents a conic, viz. two straight 
lines. 

Hence, by Art. 385, II, the equation 

LM=R' (1), 

represents a conic touching the straight lines Z = 0, and 
M = 0, where R = meets them. 



382 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Thus L — and M=0 are a pair of tangents and jS = 
the corresponding chord of contact. 

Every point which satisfies the equations M— jx^L and 
B — [xL clearly lies on (1). 

Hence the point of intersection of the straight lines 
M— fjL^L and E — fxL lies on the conic (1) for all values of 
fx. This point may be called the point "ju.." 

410. To find the equation to the straight line joining 
two jyoints "/x" and "/x"' and the equation to the tangent at 
the ^point "/x." 

Consider the equation 

aL + hM-\-R^O (1). 

Since it is of the first degree and contains two constants 
a and 6, at our disposal, it can be made to represent any 
straight line. 

If it pass through the point " /x " it must be satisfied by 
the substitutions M = fxL and B — fxL. 

Hence a + 6/x^ + /x = (2). 

Similarly, if it pass through the point " /x' " we have 

a + bfx'' + fM' = (3). 

Solving (2) and (3), we have 

a , — 1 

/X/X fX + fX 

On substitution in (1), the equation to the joining line is 

Lfxfx' + M-(ix + [x')JR = 0. 

By putting fx' = fx we have, as the equation to the 
tangent at the point "/x," 

Lfx^ + M- 2fxE = 0,

CHAPTER XYII. 

MISCELLANEOUS PROPOSITIONS. 

On the four normals that can be drawn from any point in 
the plane of a central conic to the conic. 

411, Let the equation to the conic be 

Ax' + By^^l (1). 

[If A and JB be both positive, it is an ellipse ; if one be 
positive and the other negative, it is a hyperbola.] 

The equation to the normal at any point (x, y') of the 
curve is 

X — X y — y' 

If this normal pass through the given point (/«,, k), we 
have 

h — x k — y' 

i.e. (A-£)x'y' + £hy'-Akx'=:0 (2). 

This is an equation to determine the point (cc', y') such 
that the normal at it goes through the point (h, k). It 
shews that the point (x, y') lies on the rectangular hyper- 
bola 

{A-JB)xy + £hy-Akx = (3). 

The point (x', y') is therefore both on the curve (3) and 
on the curve (1). Also these two conies intersect in four 
points, real or imaginary. There are therefore four points, 

L. 25 



386 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

in general, lying on (1), such that the normals at them pass 
through the given point (A, k). 

Also the hyperbola (3) passes through the origin and 
the point (A, k) and its asymptotes are parallel to the axes. 

Hence From a given point four normals can in general 
he drawn to a given central conic, and their feet all lie on a 
certain rectangular hyperbola, which jjasses through the 
given point and the centre of the conic, and has its asym^ptotes 
parallel to the axes of the given conic. 

412. To find the conditions that the normals at the 
points where two given straight lines meet a central conic 
may m,eet in a p)oint. 

Let the conic be 

A^-\-By''^\ (1), 

and let the normals to it at the points where it is met by 
the straight lines 

l^ + m,^ — \ (2), 

and l^x + m^y = 1 (3) 

meet in the point (h, k). 

By Art. 384, the equation to any conic passing through 
the intersection of (1) with (2) and (3) is 

Aa^ + By^ - 1 + X {l-^x + m^y — 1) (^2^ + m.^y - 1) = 0...(4). 

Since these intersections are the feet of the four 
normals drawn from (A, k), then, by the last article, the 
conic 

(A- £) xy + Bhy - Akx = (5) 

passes through the same four points. 

For some value of X it therefore follows that (4) and (5) 
are the same. 

Comparing these equations, we have, since the co- 
efficients of a^ and y^ and the constant term in (5) are all 
zero, 

A + Xl^l^ = 0, B + Xm^m^ ~ 0, and - 1 +X = 0. 

Therefore X =^ 1, and hence 

lih — ~^i and m^m^ — ~B (6).

and that to BS y = m^-\-C2 ■ (2). 

If the equation to the given conic be Ax'^ + By^=l, we then have 
(by Art. 412, Cor. 2)

If (/, g) be the fixed point through which PQ passes, we have 

g=m^f+Cj^ (5). 

Now the middle point of BS lies on the diameter conjugate to it, 
i.e. by Art. 376, on the diameter

so that, by (3), the equation to BS is

Eliminating m^ between (6) and (7), we easily have, as the equation 
to the required locus, 

{Ax^ + By^){gx+fy)+xy = 0. 

Cor. From equation (6) it follows that the diameter conjugate to 
ES is equally inclined with PQ to the axis, and hence that the points 
P and Q and the ends of the diameter conjugate to BS are coney clic 
(Art. 400),

Confocal Conies. 

415. Def. Two conies are said to be confocal when 
they have both foci common. 

To find the equation to conies which are confocal with 

the elli2^se 

2 2 

All conies having the same foci have the same centre 
and axes. 

The equation to any conic having the same centre and 
axes as the given conic is 

?4=i ••••■••;;;;;; (^)- 

The foci of (1) are at the points {^\Ja^ — h^^ 0). 
The foci of (2) are at the points {^sJA - B^ 0). 
These foci are the same if 

A-B = a^-h% 

i.e.ii A-a' = B-b''^X (say). 

.*. A^a^ + \, and B = ¥ + X. 



CONFOCAL CONICS. 393 



The equation (2) then becomes 

^ 19 . \ -^5 



which is therefore the required equation, the quantity A, 
determining the particular confocal. 

416. For different values of X to trace the conic given 
hy the equation 

^ + -^-=1 (1). 

First, let X be very great ; then a^ + X and 6^ + X are 
both very great and, the greater that X is, the more nearly 
do these quantities approach to equality. A circle of 
infinitely great radius is therefore a confocal of the 
system. 

Let X gradually decrease from infinity to zero ; the 
semi-major axis \J a'^ + X gradually decreases from infinity 
to a, and the semi-minor axis from infinity to h. When X 
is positive, the equation (1) therefore represents an ellipse 
gradually decreasing in size from an infinite circle to 
the standard ellipse 

a" b^ 

This latter ellipse is marked / in the figure. 

Next, let X gradually decrease from to — b^. The 
semi-major axis decreases from a to \/a^ — b^, and the semi- 
minor axis from b to 0. 

For these values of X the confocal is still an ellipse, 
which always lies within the ellipse /; it gradually 
decreases in size until, when X is a quantity very slightly 
greater than — b^, it is an extremely narrow ellipse very 
nearly coinciding with the line SH, which joins the two 
foci of all curves of the system. 

Next, let X be less than — b^ ; the semi-minor axis 
\/b^ + X now becomes imaginary and the curve is a hyper- 
bola ; when X is very slightly less than — b^ the curve is a 



394 



COOKDINATE GEOMETRY. 



hyperbola very nearly coinciding with the straight lines 
SX and SX'. 




[As X passes through the value — h^ it will be noted that 
the confocal instantaneously changes from the line-ellipse 
SH to the line-hyperbola SX and HX'.^ 

As X gets less and less, the semi-transverse axis Ja^ + \ 
becomes less and less, so that the ends of the transverse 
axis of the hyperbola gradually approach to C, and the 
hyperbola widens out as in the figure. 

When X = — a^, the transverse axis of the hyperbola 
vanishes, and the hyperbola degenerates into the infinite 
double line TOY'. 

When X is less than — a% both semi-axes of the conic 
become imaginary, and therefore the confocal becomes 
wholly imaginary. 

417. Through any point in the plane of a given conic 
there can he drawn two conies confocal with it; also one of 
these is an ellipse and the other a hyperbola. 

Let the equation to the given conic be 

t + t^l 
and let the given point be (f g). 



CONFOCAL CONICS. 395 

Any conic confocal with the given conic is 



If this go through the point (/, g), we have 

•^ +^^ = 1 (2). 



This is a quadratic equation to determine X and there- 
fore gives two values of X. 

Put b^ + X = fi, and hence 

a^ + X = fi + a^-b^ = fjL + aV. 
The equation (2) then becomes 

i.e. /&gt;c2 + /x(aV-/2-/)-^2^iV = (3). 

On applying the criterion of Art. 1 we at once see that 
the roots of this equation are both real. 

Also, since its last term is negative, the product of 
these roots is negative, and therefore one value of ju, is 
positive and the other is negative. 

The two values of b^ + X are therefore one positive and 
the other negative. Similarly, the two values of a^ + X can 
be shewn to be both positive. 

On substituting in (2) we thus obtain an ellipse and a 
hyperbola. 

418. Confocal conies cut at right angles. 
Let the confocals be 

+ 70 . V ^ 1, and -y— T-+TT-r^=l' 



«2 + Xi b'^ + X^ ' a'^ + X^ b'^ + X, 

and let them meet at the point ix\ y'). 

The equations to the tangents at this point are

396 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

These cut at right angles if (Art 69) 



+ 7JJ-^v€T^^v^ = ^ «• 



But, since (x\ 2/) is a common point of the two confocals, 
we have 

^ + ^ - 1 and 4- ^ - 1

**^' (a^ + X^ {a\-\- X,) ■*" (F+ Aj) (6^ + X,) " ^ ^* 

The condition (1) is therefore satisfied and hence the 
two confocals cut at right angles. 

Cor. From equation (2) it is clear that the quantities 
b^ + A-i and b^ + X^ have opposite signs ; for otherwise we 
should, have the sum of two positive quantities equal to 
zero. Two confocals, therefore, which intersect, are one an 
ellipse and the other a hyperbola. 

419. One conic and only one conic, confocal with the conic 
-2 + 12 = I5 ^^^ ^^ drawn to touch a given straight line. 

Let the equation to the given straight line be 

X cos a + y sin a =p (1) . 

Any confocal of the system is

The straight line (1) touches (2) if 

2j2= {a? + X) cos2 a + (&amp;2 + X) sin2 a (Art. 264) , 
i.e. if X =_p2 _ a? cos^ a - 6^ sin2 ^^ 

This only gives one value for X and therefore there is only one 
conic of the form (2) which touches the straight line (1). 

Also X + a,2=^2^^^2_ j2^ gin2 jj_a j.gal quantity. The conic is 
therefore real.

Curvature. 

420. Circle of Curvature. Def. If F, Q, and R 

be any three points on a conic section, one circle and only 
one circle can be drawn to pass through them. Also this 
circle is completely determined by the three points. 

Let now the points Q and R move up to, and ultimately 
coincide with, the point P ; then the limiting position of 
the above circle is called the circle of curvature at P ; also 
the radius of this circle is called the radius of curvature at 
Pj and its centre is called the centre of curvature at P. 

421, Since the circle of curvature at P meets the 
conic in three coincident points at P, it will cut the curve 
in one other point P'. The line PP' which is the line 
joining P to the other point of intersection of the conic and 
the circle of curvature is called the common chord of 
curvature.

CIRCLES OF CURVATURE. 399 

We shewed, in Art. 400, that, if a circle and a conic 
intersect in four points, the line joining one pair of points 
of intersection and the line joining the other pair are 
equally inclined to the axis. In our case, one pair of 
points is two of the coincident points at P, and the line 
joining them therefore the tangent at P ; the other pair of 
points is the third point at P and the point P', and the 
line joining them the chord of curvature PP'. Hence the 
tangent at P and the chord of curvature PP' are, in any 
conic, equally inclined to the axis. 

4t^2i, To find the equation to the circle of curvature and 
the length of the radius of curvature at any point (af, 2at) 
of the parabola y"^ = 4:ax. 

If S=0 be the equation to a conic, T=0 the equation 
to the tangent at the point P, whose coordinates are at^ and 
2at, and L = the equation to any straight line passing 
through P, we know, by Art. 384, that jS + \.L.T=0 is 
the equation to the conic section passing through three 
coincident points at P and through the other point in which 
X = meets aS^-0. 

If A. and L be so chosen that this conic is a circle, it will 
be the circle of curvature at P, and, by the last article, we 
know that L = will be equally inclined to the axis with 
T=0. 

In the case of a parabola 

S = 2/2 - iax, and T=ty-x- af. (Art. 229.) 

Also the equation to a line through {af, 2at) equally 
inclined with :Z' = to the axis is 

t(y— 2at) + x — at'~0, 

so that L ^ ty + X — Sat^. 

The equation to the circle of curvature is therefore 

y^ — 4ax ■{■ \(ty — X — af) {ty + x — ^af) = 0, 

where 1 + Xi^ = — A., i.e. \ = —^ ^ •

On substituting this value of A,, we have, as the required

x^ + y'- "lax {W + 2) + iayt^ - ZaH"" = 0, 

i.e. [x-a{2 + 3f)J + [y + 2at^f = ia? (1 + ff. 

The circle of curvature has therefore its centre at 
the point (2a + ^af, — 2af) and its radius equal to 

2a (1 + ff.

424. If a circle and an ellipse intersect in four points, 
the sum of their eccentric angles is equal to an even 
multiple of tt. [Page 235, Ex. 18.] 

If then the circle of curvature at a point P, whose 
eccentric angle is 6, meet the curve again in Q^ whose 
eccentric angle is ^, three of these four points coincide at 
P, so that three of these eccentric angles are equal to 0, 
whilst the fourth is equal to ^. We therefore have 

3^ + &lt;^ = an even multiple of tt =::: 2mr. 

Hence, if &lt;^ be supposed given, i.e. if Q be given, we

EVOLUTE OF A CURVE.

Hence through any point Q on an ellipse can be drawn 
three circles which are the circles of curvature at three 
points Pj, /*2&gt; &lt;^^^ -^3' -Also the four points Pj, Pg, P3, and 
Q all lie on another circle. 

425. E volute of a Curve. The locus of the 
centres of curvature at different points of a curve is called 
the evolute of the curve. 



426. Evolute of the parabola 'if=A:ax. 

Let (x, y) be the centre of curvature at the point (&lt;x^^, 2a^) 
of this curve. 

Then ic = a (2 + Zf) and ^ = - "latK (Art. 422.) 

.-. {x-2ay=21aH'=^^ay\ 

i.e. the locus of the centre of curvature is the curve 

21ay^ = i{x~2ay. 

This curve meets the axis of x in the point (20-, 0). 

It also meets the parabola 
where 

27a2aj = (a;-2a)^ 
i. e. where x = ^a, 
and therefore 

y = ^4.J2a. 

Hence it meets the parabola at 
the points 

(8a, ±4^2«). 

The curve is called a semi- 
cubical parabola and could be shewn 
to be of the shape of the dotted curve in the figure.

The equation to the evolute of

428. Contact of different orders. If two conies, 
or curves, touch, i.e. have two coincident points in common 
they are said to have contact of the first order. The 
tangent to a conic therefore has contact of the first order 
with it. 

If two conies have three coincident points in common, 
they are said to have contact of the second order. The 
circle of curvature of a conic therefore has contact of the 
second order with it. 

If two conies have four coincident points in common, 
they are said to have contact of the third order. No 
conies, which are not coincident, can have more than four 
coincident points ; for a conic is completely determined if 
five points on it be given. Contact of the third order is 
therefore all that two conies can have, and then they are 
said to osculate one another. 

Since a circle is completely determined when three 
points on it are given we cannot, in general, obtain a circle 
to have contact of a higher order than the second with a 
given conic. The circle of curvature is therefore often called 
the osculating circle. 



CONTACT OF DIFFERENT ORDERS. 405 

In general, one curve osculates another when it has the 
highest possible order of contact with the second curve. 

429. Equation to a conic osculating another conic. 

If S—0 be the equation to a conic and T=0 the 
tangent at any point of it, the conic S = \T^ passes through 
four coincident points of S=0 at the point where T—0 
touches it. (Art. 385, lY.) 

Hence S= \T^ is the equation to the required osculating 
conic. 

Ex. The equation of any conic osculating the conic 

ax^ + 2hxy + bif-2fy = (1) 

at the origin is 

ax^ + 2hxy + b7f-2fy + \y^=0 , (2). 

For the tangent to (1) at the origin iay = 0. 

If (2) be a parabola, we have h^ = a{b + 'K), so that its equation is 

{ax + hy)^=2afy. 

If (2) be a rectangular hyperbola, we have a + b + \ = 0, and the 
equation to the osculating rectangular hyperbola is 

a {x^ - 2/2) + 2hxy- 2fy = 0.

Envelopes. 

430. Consider any point P on a circle whose centre 
is and whose radius is a. The straight line through P 
at right angles to OP is a tangent to the circle at P. 
Conversely, if through we draw any straight line OP oi 
length a, and if through the end P we draw a straight 
line perpendicular to OP^ this latter straight line touches, 
or envelopes, a circle of radius a and centre 0, and this 
circle is said to be the envelope of the straight lines drawn 
in this manner. 

Again, if S be the focus of a parabola, and PY be the 
tangent at any point P of it meeting the tangent at the 



408 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

vertex in the point Y, then we know (Art. 211, 8) that 
STP is a right angle. Conversely, if S be joined to any 
point J' on a given line, and a straight line be drawn 
through Y perpendicular to SY, this line, so drawn, always 
touches, or envelopes, a parabola whose focus is S and such 
that the given line is the tangent at its vertex. 

431. Envelope. Def. The curve which is touched 
by each of a series of lines, which are all drawn to satisfy 
some given condition, is called the Envelope of these 
lines. 

As an example, consider the series of straight lines 
which are drawn so that each of them cuts off from a pair 
of fixed straight lines a triangle of constant area. 

We know (Art. 330) that any tangent to a hyperbola 
always cuts off a triangle of constant area from its asymp- 
totes. 

Conversely, we conclude that, if a variable straight line 
cut off a constant area from two given straight lines, it 
always touches a hyperbola whose asymptotes are the two 
given straight lines, i. e. that its envelope is a hyperbola. 

432. If the equatio7i to any curve involve a variable 
parameter, in the first degree only, the curve always passes 
through a fixed point or points. 

For if X be the variable parameter, the equation to the 
curve can be written in the form S + \S' — 0, and this 
equation is always satisfied by the points which satisfy 
S = and S' = 0, i.e. the curve always passes through the 
point, or points, of intersection oi S-Q and S' = [compare 
Art. 97]. 

433. Curve touched hy a variable straight line whose 
equation involves, in the second degree, a variable parameter. 

As an example, let us find the envelope of the straight 
lines given by the equation 

m^x — my + a = (1), 

where m is a quantity which, by its variation, gives the 
series of straight lines. 



ENVELOPES. 409 

If (1) pass through the fixed point (A, ^), we have 

w^h — mk + a = (2). 

This is an equation giving the values of m correspond- 
ing to the straight lines of the series which pass through 
the point (A, li). There can therefore be drawn two 
straight lines from (A, ^) to touch the required envelope. 

As (A, Aj) moves nearer and nearer to the required 
envelope these two tangents approach more and more 
nearly to coincidence, until, when (A, h) is taken on the 
envelope, the two tangents coincide. 

Conversely, if the two tangents given by (2) coincide, 
the point (A, U) lies on the envelope. 

Now the roots of (2) are equal if l? = 4:ah, 

so that the locus of (A, k), i. e. the required envelope, is the 
parabola y^ = 4:ax. 

Hence, more simply, the envelope of the straight line (1 ) 
is the curve whose equation is obtained by writing down 
the condition that the equation (1), considered as a quad- 
ratic equation in m, may have equal roots. 

By writing (1) in the form 

a 

y = mx H — , 
m 

it is clear that it always touches the parabola y^ = ^ax. 

In the next article we shall apply this method to the 
general case. 

434. To find the envelope of a straight line whose 
equation involves^ in the second degree, a variable parameter. 

The equation to the straight line is of the form 

X^P-{-\Q + R = (1), 

where X is a variable parameter and P, Q^ and M are 
expressions of the first degree in x and y. 

Equation (1) may be looked upon as an equation 
giving the two values of X corresponding to any given 
point T. 



410 COORDINATE GEOMETRY. 

Through this given point two straight lines to touch the 
required envelope may therefore be drawn. 

If the point T be taken on the required envelope, the 
two tangents that can be drawn from it coalesce into the 
one tangent at T to the envelope. 

Conversely, if the two straight lines given by (1) 
coincide, the resulting condition will give us the equation 
to the envelope. 

But the condition that (1) shall have equal roots is 

Q^ = 4.PR (2). 

This is therefore the equation to the required envelope. 

Since P, Q, and R are all expressions of the first degree, 
the equation (2) is, in general, an equation of the second 
degree, and hence, in general, represents a conic section. 

The envelope of any straight line, whose equation 
contains an arbitrary parameter and square thereof, is 
therefore always a conic. 

435. The method of the previous article holds even if 
P, Q, and R be not necessarily linear expressions. It 
follows that the envelope of any family of curves, whose 
equation contains a variable parameter X, in the second 
degree, is found by writing down the condition that the 
equation, considered as an equation in X, may have equal 
roots. 

436. Ex. 1. Find the envelope of the straight line which cuts off 
from two given straight lines a triangle of constant area. 

Let the given straight lines be taken as the axes of coordinates and 
let them be inclined at an angle w. 

The equation to a straight line cutting off intercepts / and g from 
the axes is 

rl=' &lt;^&gt;- 

If the area of the triangle cut off be constant, we have 
\f .g . sin w = const., 
i.e, fg=zconst.=K^ (2). 

On substitution for g in (1), the equation to the straight line 
becomes f'y -fIO + K^x=:0. 



ENVELOPES. EXAMPLES. 411 

By the last article, the envelope of this line, for different values of 
/, is given by the equation 

I.e. xy=-^. 

The result is therefore a hyperbola whose asymptotes coincide with 
the axes of coordinates. 

Ex. 2. Find the envelope of the straight line ivhich is such that 
the product of the perpendiculars draiun to it from two fixed points is 
constant. 

Take the middle point of the line joining the two fixed points as 
the origin, the line joining them as the axis of x, and let the two 
points be {d, 0) and {-d, 0). 

Let the variable straight line have as equation 

y=mx + c. 
The condition then gives 

md + c -md + c , , ^„ 

X = constant = ^% 



jjl + m^ Jl + m^' 
so that c^ - viH^ =A^{1+ m^) . 

The equation to the variable straight line is then 

y-'mx=c= fJ{A'^ + d^)m^ + A^. 
Or, on squaring, 

mP (a;2 -A^- d^) - 2mxy + (y^ - A^) = 0. 
By Art. 435, the envelope of this is 

[2xyf = 4 (a;2 - ^2 _ ^2) (^2 _ ^2) ^ 

This is an ellipse whose axes are the axes of coordinates and whose 
foci are the two given points. 

Ex. 3. Find the envelope of chords of an ellipse the tangents at the 
end of ivhich intersect at right angles. 

Let the ellipse be — „ + ^r, = 1. 
a^ 0^ 

If the tangents intersect at right angles, their point of intersection 

P must lie on the director circle, and hence its coordinates must be of 

the form (c cos ^, c sin 6), where c = Ja'^+ h^. 

The chord is then the polar of P with respect to the ellipse, and 
hence its equation is 

x . c cos 6 V .c sin d ^

Ex. 4. The normals at four points of an ellipse meet in a point ; 
if the line joining one pair of these points pass through a fixed point, 
prove that the line joining the other pair envelopes a parabola which 
touches the axes. 

Let the equation to the ellipse be 

%*t=^ W' 

and let the equation to the two pairs of lines through the points be 

lx+m7j = l (2), 

and lj^x + miy = l (3). 

By Art. 412, Cor. (1), we then have 

11-^= — 2 ^^^ *^%=~i^ W* 

If the straight line (3) pass through the fixed point (/, g), we have 

BO that, by (4), -X_^|_=l,

If this value of I be substituted in (2), it becomes

i.e, {a^gy - V^fxf + 2.a%^ {bjx + a?gy) + a%'^=0 (5) . 

This is a parabola since the terms of the second degree form a 
perfect square. Also, putting in succession x and y equal to zero, we 
get perfect squares, so that the parabola touches both axes.

[Equation (1) contains two independent parameters —

could therefore solve (2) to give - in terms of — : on sub- 

^ ' n n 

stituting in (1) we should then have an equation containing 

one independent parameter and its envelope could then be 

found. 

It is easier, however, to proceed as follows.] 

Eliminating n between (1) and (2), we see that the 
equation to the straight line may be written in the form

i.e., on reduction,

Cor. The envelope is a parabola if

438. Ex. Find the envelope of all chords of the parabola y^ = 4aa; 
lohich subtend a given angle a at the vertex. 

Any straight line is

The lines joining the origin to its intersections with the parabola 
are, (by Art. 122), ny^ = - 4:ax {Ix + my) , 

i.e. ny^ + 4:a'mxy + 4alx^=0.

11, The locus can be shewn to be a straight line which is perpendi- 
cular to the given straight line ; also the given straight line 
touches one of the confocals and its pole with respect to that 
confocal is its point of contact ; this point of contact therefore 
lies on the locus, which is therefore the normal. 

14. As in Art. 366, use the Invariants of Art. 135.

5. Two of the normals drawn from coincide, since it is a centre of 
curvature. The straight line l■^x + 7n-j^^tJ = l (Art. 412) is therefore 
a tangent to the ellipse at some point &lt;p and hence, by Art. 412, 
the equation to QB can be found in terms of (p.

19. The line joining the foci is a particular case of the confocals and 
the polar of O with respect to it is the major axis ; the minor 
axis is another particular case, so that two of the polars are lines 
through G at right angles ; also the tangents at to the con- 
focals through it are two of the polars, and these are at right 
angles. Thus both G and are on the directrix. 

21. The crease is clearly the line bisecting at right angles the line 
joining the initial position of G to the position which C occupies 
when the paper is folded.
